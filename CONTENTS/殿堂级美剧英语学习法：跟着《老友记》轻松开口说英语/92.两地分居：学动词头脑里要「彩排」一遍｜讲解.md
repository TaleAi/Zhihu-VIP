 **对话文本：** 


**Monica:** Hey Joey.


**Joey:** Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?


**Monica:** Joey, I am not going to objectify women with you! *(Looks at the woman.)* But if her face is as nice as her ass, woah mamma!


**Joey:** All right thanks. Oh hey, have you talked to Chandler?


**Monica:** Yeah, he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.


**Joey:** How come?


**Monica:** He has to work, there's some big rush on the ... ah damn it, one of these days I'm gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.


**Joey:** Hey. Why don't you fly out there and surprise him?


**Monica:** Maybe I will go....Yeah, we'll have a little second honeymoon at the Tulsa Ramada.


 


**场景 2：Ross 询问 Phoebe 和 Mike 约会的情况。**

**对话文本：** 


**Ross:** So how'd the date go?


**Phoebe:** Well, it was awful! Every time I thought about what you said, I started crying.


**Ross:** So he hasn't called?


**Phoebe:** Would you call this girl? *(Fake crying)* Thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing.


**Ross:** Now I feel terrible, this is all my fault.


**Phoebe:** Well, you know what you should feel terrible about? This could have been my serious guy! He was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?


**Ross:** We are a rare breed. 


 


**词汇短语点睛：**


Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?


turn around 这里就表示「转身」， I can't tell 中的 tell 的意思「判断」的意思。


 


I am not going to objectify women with you! 


objectify 有「物化」的意思。


 


there's some big rush on the ...


big rush on sth 表达的含义是「在...事情上赶」，这里说的就是 Chandler 要赶项目。


 


one of these days I'm gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job


one of these days 在口语里表示「总有一天」，强调的是临近的将来，Monica 的意思就是之前她不怎么在意，不过现在「我应该要开始认真听他讲工作的事情了。」


 


Yeah, we'll have a little second honeymoon at the Tulsa Ramada.


这里 Monica 提到想去过个二度蜜月，Tulsa Ramada 就是位于 Tulsa 的华美达连锁酒店。


 


So how'd the date go?


Ross 询问 Phoebe 之前那次约会如何。how'd 这里说全了是 how did，非常口语化的省略，因为熟人之间也不用字正腔圆，每个单词都读得非常清楚。


 


Every time I thought about what you said, I started crying.


注意这里 thought 和 started 用的都是过去式。


 


This is all my fault


意思是「这都是我的错。」


 


Well, you know what you should feel terrible about? This could have been my serious guy! 


前面的问句有「自问自答」的感觉，后面 Phoebe 回忆的是过去的场景，语气没有 should 这么强烈，所以用了 could have been，意思就是这个男的有可能是可以去认真对待的。


 


He was sweet and smart and funny. 


意思就是「他贴心、聪明又幽默风趣。」


 


Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?


how hard it is to meet a guy like that 就相当于一个「大块头名词」接在 Do you know 之后。


 


We are a rare breed. 


字面意思是「我们是稀有品种」，实际 Ross 想表达就是他也是同样的 sweet, smart and funny。


 


**地道句型活用：**


How come?


表示「为什么？为什么这样？」后面也可以直接跟句子，这句说全了就是 How come he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend？


 


**学动词头脑里要「彩排」一遍**


本课第一段对话中，Joey 说 Why don't you fly out there and surprise him?fly out there 字面意思是「飞到那儿」，在练习这个短语的时候要结合画面，想象自己在纽约，Chandler 在离纽约很远的 Tulsa，fly out there 就有一种从纽约「大老远地飞过去」的含义。每次在学动词的时候都要这样「彩排」一遍，对于动词的把握才会更加精准，口语中才能自如运用。
