**对话文本：** 


**Ross:** So why are you so dressed up?


**Phoebe:** Oh umm. Mike's picking me up for a date.


**Ross:** Oh yea? Now um, how is that going, is it getting serious?


**Phoebe:** Oh I dunno, I dunno, I mean you know, I like him but am I ready to take my grade-A loins off the meat market? I』m not quite sure.


**Ross:** You know, I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy. I'm always like, is this moving too fast? Is this moving too slow? Where's this going?


**Phoebe:** Yeah, you know, you are a bit of a drama queen.


**Ross:** But you, you're so much better off. You know, you just go from guy to guy having fun and not worrying that it never turns into anything serious.


**Phoebe:** I wouldn't say never, you know. There's that guy ... well what about...OK well there's gotta be someone.


**Ross:** There isn't. That's what I'm saying.


**Phoebe:** Oh my God, you're right!


**Ross:** I know, and yet here you are, all ready for the next date.


**Phoebe:** I can't believe I never realized this before. I'm in my 30s and I』ve never been in a long-term relationship! Oh my God! *(Starts crying.)* What's wrong with me?


**Ross:** No, no, no there's nothing wrong with you. I mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.


**Phoebe:** I wanna get married! *(Grabs a tissue.)*


**Ross:** Please don't cry because of me, Pheebs. I don't know what I'm talking about. I've been divorced three times!


**Phoebe:** At least you've been married! Oh my God! I wanna trade lives with Ross! *(Cries.)*


**词汇短语点睛：**


So why are you so dressed up?


dress up 有「穿着正式；盛装打扮」的意思。其反义词是 dress down，意思就是穿着打扮随便轻松。另外还有一组词形容一个人穿着打扮：overdressed（过于正式）；underdressed（太不正式）。


Mike's picking me up for a date.


pick someone up 有「接某人」的意思。


Yeah, you know, you are a bit of a drama queen.


drama queen 字面意思是「戏剧女王」，实际可以用来形容喜欢小题大做，反应激烈夸张的人。


But you, you're so much better off. 


这里 better off 说的是 Ross 觉得 Phoebe 在对待男女关系上，整个状态要比他好，注意这里 off 不能省略，去掉 off 就变成了形容 Phoebe 这个人变得更好。


I know, and yet here you are, all ready for the next date.


这里 here you are 表达的含义就是「你看一下你自己（现在这个状态）」，这里 Ross 说的是 Phoebe 一段恋情刚结束又可以马上跟其他人约会了。


I can't believe I never realized this before. 


这句意思是「真不敢相信，我之前从来没有意识到这一点。」


I'm in my 30s and I』ve never been in a long-term relationship!


in one's 30s 就是「在某人 30 多岁时」，如果再精确一些，还可以说 in one's early 30s（30-33 岁），in one's mid 30s(34-36 岁),in one's late 30s( 37-39 岁)。a long-term relationship 指一段长期稳定的关系。


You don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.


这句意思是「你给我的印象是那种不会想结婚的人。」strike someone as...就相当于 give someone the impression that...即「给某人的印象是...」。


Oh my God! I wanna trade lives with Ross! 


trade lives with 字面意思是「和...交换人生」，这里 Phoebe 说她竟然要和 Ross 交换人生，言外之意就是她竟然要羡慕 Ross 的人生。（因为之前 Phoebe 都是鄙视 Ross 的人生）


**地道句型活用：**


I'm always like,...


这里的 like 就是表示「我一直呈现出下面这个样子/状态」，类似还有像 I was like…，意思就是「我当时（的反应/感觉/就说…）」，在口语中很常见，有些时候要描述某种情况，可是没有适合的词汇描述，就会用到。 


That's what I'm saying.


口语里常用，表示肯定的语气，意思就是「我就说吧。」


**英文的隐晦表达不比中文少** 


英语中也有一些隐晦、生动的表达，本课对话中，Phoebe 说到 I like him but am I ready to take my grade-A loins off the meat market? I』m not quite sure.这里 to take my grade-A loins off the meat market 字面意思是「从肉市场把我这种 A 级别的里脊肉下架」，引申表达的含义就是 Phoebe 把自己比喻为「最高级别的 A 级里脊肉」，她说还没有准备好「从市场上退下来」。言外之意就是她认为自己仍然是许多人追求的优秀女性，现在也还没考虑结婚，稳定下来。
