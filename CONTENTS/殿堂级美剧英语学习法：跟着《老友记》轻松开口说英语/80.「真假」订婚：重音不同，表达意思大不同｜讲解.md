【本课对话取自第九季第 1 集】


**场景： Rachel 把自己被求婚的事情告诉了 Phoebe，因为没提对方姓名，Phoebe 以为是 Ross 求婚，感到是自己之前的劝说起了作用。**

**对话文本：** 


**Phoebe:** Hey!


**Rachel:** Hi.


**Phoebe:** Are you all right?


**Rachel:** Uhh - I think I just got engaged.


**Phoebe:** Oh my God! He did it?


**Rachel:** Well - did you know he was gonna ask me?


**Phoebe:** Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.


**Rachel:** And you really think this is a good idea?


**Phoebe:** I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired, people.


**Rachel:** I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.


**Phoebe:** Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.


**Rachel:** Really?! Even Ross?


**Phoebe:** Especially Ross!


**Joey:** Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.


**Ross:** Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I guess I'll just - I'll come back.


**Phoebe:** There he goes, your fiancé.


**Rachel:** I guess so.


**Phoebe:** Although he does play with himself in his sleep.


**Rachel:** I can't say I'm surprised.


**词汇短语点睛：**


I think I just got engaged.


get engaged 或 be engaged 都可以用来表示「订婚」。一般男方向女方求婚成功之后，两个人就处于 engaged 这样一个状态。


Well - did you know he was gonna ask me?


意思是「你知道他要向我求婚吗？」练习这句话的时候要头脑中想象过去的场景，有意识地培养自己对于 did、was 这样表示过去时态的用法。


I'm like the one who talked him into it. 


like 是口语中起到停顿作用的语气词，非常高频使用，其他的还包括像 was like，well，you know，kinda 等等。talk sb into 有「说服某人...」的意思。


I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.


puppet 是「木偶」的意思，puppet master 指的就是背后娴熟操控木偶的人，这里 Phoebe 是得意自己是整件事情背后那个关键人物，一切都在她的掌握之中。


The puppet master gets tired, people.


这里 Phoebe 说 people，她脑海中画面是自己作为「木偶大师」，面对台下一群观众的称呼，说自己也会累的。


Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here.


full house 原本有「座无虚席」的含义，这里 Ross 的意义就是「这里人看来还挺多的。」


There he goes, your fiancé.


fiancé是从法语里借过来的词，指「未婚夫」，「未婚妻」则是 fiancée，两个单词的读音是完全一样的。


I can't say I'm surprised.


这句的意思是「我一点儿都不惊讶。」


**地道句型活用：**


I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. 


don't tell me 可以表达「别告诉我...」，但是如果是单独一句「Don't tell me！」意思是「我才不信呢！(骗谁呢你)」。


You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.


be meant to be/do 意思是「注定要」，另外还可以表达「（照道理）应该做」，例如 He was meant to be get there on time.（照道理他应该准时到那儿的。）


**重音不同，表达意思大不同**


本课对话中，Phoebe 说到一句 I'm like the one who talked him into it.之后有重复说到 I just talked him into it...,虽然表达的是同一个意思，即她之前和 Ross 谈过关于他应该和 Rachel 结婚这件事，不过在第二句中 Phoebe 在「him」这个词上加重了语气，说的非常清楚，而前面一句是略读。因为第二句 Phoebe 是想强调她刚劝了 Ross，不想再劝 Rachel。这种细微的差别在学习口语对话中也要特别留意。
