**对话文本：** 


**Chandler:** Hello everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?


**Ken:** That's right. Is it true that the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?


**Chandler:** Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started by taking a look at last quarter's figures. *(Claudia, next to Chandler, lights a cigarette.)* Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the boss's ass?


**Claudia:** I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?


**Chandler:** No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office though, right?


**Claudia:** Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?


**Chandler:** Alright, look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. *(Everyone lights up.)* So you all smoke then? It』s almost rude, that I'm not smoking.


**Ken:** Well, that's not true, if you don't wanna smoke ...


**Chandler:** *(loud)* Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.


**Ken:** I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back inNew York?


**Chandler:** I』ve always liked you, Ken.


 


**词汇短语点睛：**


Is it true that the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?


fell asleep 表示「睡着了」，take the job 指的是「接受这份工作」。say yes to something 口语里可以表示「支持某事、同意某事」。


 


Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. 


注意这里 hear 并没有用过去式，即 Chandler 并没有专门指过去那次会议上的事情，而是人生一般意义上的建议：「不要相信你听到的每件事，不要道听途说」。


 


Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the boss's ass?


这里 Chandler 是一语双关，一方面同事 Claudia 正对着 Chandler 吐烟，而不是往上，另外 blow smoke up someone's ass 在俚语中也可以表示「拍马屁」。


 


I smoked for years, then I quit.


这里 Chandler 说「我之前抽了好多年，后来戒了。」for years 表示「好多年」，quit smoking 就是「戒烟」。


 


You're not allowed to smoke in this office though, right?


though 放在句尾，有「但是，不过」的含义，实际只是表示语气上一种相对委婉的转折。


 


Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less.


注意这里 Yes 针对的是事实本身，即「是允许抽烟的"，而中文表达习惯是针对整句话，回答就变成了「不对，这里是允许抽烟的」。be legal to do sth 表示「做某事是合法的」。fifteen people or less 指的就是「15 人或 15 人以下」。


 


But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. 


light up 原本有「照亮」的含义，这句里面表示的是「点烟」。 


 


If I smoke, my wife would kill me.


kill 这里也是夸张的表达，Chandler 的意思就是「如果我抽烟，我老婆不会放过我的。」


 


I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?


I'm sorry, but...这里并不是表示道歉，而是表示一种转折的语气。 back 这里表示空间上的跨越。


 


I』ve always liked you, Ken.


字面意思是「我一直都很喜欢你，Ken。」这里表达的语气就是「正合我意」。


 


**地道句型活用：**


Now, before we get started, are there any questions?


get started 表示「开始」，get+过去分词这个句型在口语中很常用，比如 get divorced（离婚）、get engaged（订婚）、get confused（迷惑不解）等等。


 


**It 是个奇妙的万能词**


留意本课对话中 it 的用法：


It's nice to see our team together for the first time.


Is it true that the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?


It's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. 


It』s almost rude, that I'm not smoking.


句子中真正的主语被后置，避免了「头重脚轻」，比如第一句的也能说成 Seeing our team together for the first time is nice.但英语里更喜欢用 it 放开头，后面再具体描述。这个和中文表达习惯不同，所以要刻意练习才能在自己的口语中能非常自然和正确的使用 it。
