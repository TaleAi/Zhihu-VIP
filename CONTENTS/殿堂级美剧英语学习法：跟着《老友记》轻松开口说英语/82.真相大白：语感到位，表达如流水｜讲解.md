**对话文本：** 


**Ross:** You said you'd marry Joey?


**Rachel:** OK, you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married. I'm not helping.


**Ross:** So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?


**Rachel:** That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mommy a present but I am prepared to let that go.


**Ross:** So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.


**Rachel:** Well… Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.


**Ross:** Well, Chandler's my oldest friend. Joey's my NO! Ah!


**Rachel:** Ooooo!


**Joey:** Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to say goodbye.


**Ross:** Rachel said she'd marry you!


**Joey:** This isn't the right room, sorry folks.


 


**场景 2：Joey 看到 Chandler 很困，后来得知他是因为整晚为第二天的部门会议担心而失眠。**

**对话文本：** 


**Joey:** Why're you so tired?


**Chandler:** I couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today. The more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. You know, I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get 5 hours sleep. No matter what I did, I couldn't fall asleep.


**Joey:** You know what you should've done, you should』ve told yourself that little story.


**词汇短语点睛：**


You said you'd marry Joey?


you'd 是 you would 的缩写。


OK, you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody.


exhausted 指的是「极其疲倦；精疲力竭的」，它形容人非常疲惫，所表达的程度要高于「tired」。emotional 指的是「情绪容易激动的」。


So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?


这里 just had our baby 就表示「刚生下我们的小孩」。


That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mommy a present but I am prepared to let that go.


be supposed to do sth 指的是「本应该做某事」，let sth go/let go of sth 字面意思是「放开某个东西」，也可以指心理上的「放弃某事，算了」。


So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.


start sth up again 指的是「重新开始」，这里 Ross 指的就是他和 Rachel 的能重新变成男女朋友关系。


Well, Chandler's my oldest friend. 


old friend 字面上确实是「老朋友」的意思，但它仅仅指的是相识已久的朋友。


This isn't the right room, sorry folks.


folks 口语里就表示「大伙儿；各位」，就相当于 guys。


I couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today. 


divisional meeting 指的就是「部门会议」。这里要注意 Chandler 是回忆昨天晚上已经过去的场景，所以用的是 I couldn't...,I started...。


You know, I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get 5 hours sleep.


I was like 表示的意思就是「我当时就像下面这个状态/我当时心里在想」。


**地道句型活用：**


I'm not helping.


这里 Rachel 的意思是感觉自己前面的解释没有什么作用，本意是让 Ross 不再那么生气，结果越说越有点「帮倒忙」的感觉。当你要和一个人说「别添乱；别帮倒忙了」就可以说 you are not helping!


Hey you guys I'm gonna take off.


take off 口语中常用来表示自己即将离开，和对方道个别，表示「我要走了。」正式场合 take off 通常指的是「飞机起飞」。


The more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. 


the more..., the more 基本意思是「越……，越……」。


**重音不同，表达意思大不同**


在第一段对话中，Joey 说到两句话：


You said you**'d** marry Joey?


Rachel said she**'d** marry you!


这两句中的'd 都是 would 的缩写，Ross 在说的时候并没有特别清楚把 d 音发出来，而是有个短暂的停顿，这里要注意的是我们在练习口语的时候，要培养这样的语感。假设没有这个停顿，听到信息还是 You said you marry Joey?，Rachel said she marry you!但语感上就会让人感到别扭，久而久之你也能有这样的辨别力，自己的口语表达才会更加地道。
