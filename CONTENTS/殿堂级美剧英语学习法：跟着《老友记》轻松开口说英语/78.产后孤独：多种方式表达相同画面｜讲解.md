**对话文本：** 


**Joey:** Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?


**Chandler:** Sure.


**Joey:** Dude I just did something terrible.


**Chandler:** That was you?! I thought it was Jack!


**Joey:** No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!


**Chandler:** What?! Why does she think that?


**Joey:** Because it kinda looked like I did.


**Chandler:** Again, what?!


**Joey:** Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.


**Chandler:** As we all are at some point during the day.


**Joey:** It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!


**Chandler:** Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?


**Joey:** I guess.


**Chandler:** And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!


**Joey:** I know! I know it's awful.


**Chandler:** Well, what did she say?


**Joey:** She said yes.


**Chandler:** Does Ross know?


**Joey:** Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?


**Chandler:** Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.


**Joey:** Oh, I like that. Yeah -


**Chandler:** If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!


**Joey:** Now let's not get carried away.


**词汇短语点睛：**


Can I talk to you for a second?


second 有「秒」的意思，这里 for a second 就是「一会儿」的意思，泛指时间短，整个句子的意思就是「我能和你聊一会儿吗？」second 在口语中还可以缩读成 sec。


That was you?! I thought it was Jack!


注意这里 it 的用法，it 指代人时都是推测、猜想不确定身份。、


Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!


「向某人求婚」最简单的说法就是 ask someone to marry someone。


Because it kinda looked like I did.


意思是「因为看起来好像是我跟她求婚了。」kinda 意思相当于 somewhat, more or less，就是「有些，有点儿」的意思。


Again, what?!


这里 again 表达的意思说全了就是 I'm going to ask you this again.（我要再问你一遍。）


I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.


be down on one knee 意思就是「单膝跪地」。


As we all are at some point during the day.


the day 指的就是男人求婚的那一天，at some point 指的是「在某一个时刻」。


It fell out of Ross's jacket! 


fall out 这里的意思就是「掉落出来」。


And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!


kneel down 有「往下跪」的意思，通常指的是双膝跪地。 propose 可以表示「求婚」，向某人求婚就是 propose to someone。


If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!


clear up 字面上有「把…收拾整齐，打扫干净」的意思，这里指的是「把你和 Rachel 之间的事情做个澄清，解释清楚」.


kick one's ass 字面上意思是 「踢某人屁股」，口语里表达的就是「揍某人」的意思


Now let's not get carried away.


get carried away 字面意思是「把...搬走，被带走了「，这里指的就是 Chandler 说话有点扯远了。


**地道句型活用：**


I guess.


I guess.在口语中常用，不是说「我猜」，而是表达「我想是吧；我觉得是这样」的含义。


This is gonna kill him! 


这里的 kill him 就是指「让他不爽；伤害到他」。Kill 也是美国口语中常用的小词，其他的一些表达包括：dressed to kill（精心打扮得漂亮、时髦），It's killing me.（我的头很痛，好难过，简直要我的命!）表示某事很折腾人的意思。You killed it.（干得好，表现得很好。）等等。


**多种方式表达相同画面**


本课对话中我们学习了关于「向某人求婚」的两种表达：ask someone to marry someone，propose to someone，两个表达方式所描绘的是同一个画面，以后你会发现越是口语化的表达往往用词就越多，就像前面的 I asked her to marry me. 都用的是小词，后面第二个 propose 就稍显正式，直接说 I was proposing.就可以表达同样的意思。
