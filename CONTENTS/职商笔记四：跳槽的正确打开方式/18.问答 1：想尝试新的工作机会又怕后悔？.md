**今日问答：**


我目前从事汽车技术研发工作，但是并不喜欢。我非常后悔在校期间没有进行职业规划。现在，我想从事项目管理的工作，但又害怕自己的软实力不够。而且换工作也意味着要放弃先前的工作经验，可是现在我也不知道是否喜欢项目管理。我怎样才能做出一个不后悔的决定？


**职商专家回答：**


说实话，大多数大学生都没有做职业规划的意识。也只有到了开始工作的时候才会知道你究竟会喜欢什么样的职位或是行业，所以不要对自己太苛刻。这是很正常的现象。


之前有说过，我拿的是机械工程的学位，职业生涯的头 5 年都在做研发设计工程师，我也觉得不大喜欢。我在决心从商的时候，也感到过不确定，害怕去改变。我缺乏所需的新技能，比如说良好的沟通能力，商业嗅觉，还有好几种关键的软实力。所以我当时也得学习好多新东西，克服许多新的挑战。


但是我的看法是，虽然我会面临很多新的挑战，但如果我换了工作，就有很大可能会找到自己更加喜欢做的事情。可是如果我留在原地，根本看不到更好的未来的可能。这么一看，变动的选择就再明白不过了。


顺带一提，我在工程上花了将近十年的时间（四年拿学位，五年半工作），但我毫不后悔放弃我并不真心喜欢的东西。在有机会的时候没有去追求会让你更快乐的东西，这才是你会为之后悔的事。


所以我的个人观点是，你还很年轻。把这次机会当作一个挑战吧。准备好学习、尝试新鲜的东西，兴奋起来，因为很可能你就要去追寻能让你更快乐的事情了。


如果不奏效，最差的情况也不过是，你总能回去做先前的工作，回到那个你不太满意的职位上去。相信我，那个位置还会在原地等你的，因为你已经证明了做这份工作的能力。但我认为这不会发生。我相信一旦你开始这种转变，你就会乐在新环境提供的挑战与可能性之中，根本不会想回到从前。


 


**Today'Topic：**


I do R&D work,but don』t like it.I regret not making career plans in school.Now,I want to do project management,but don't think my soft skills are good enough.I』ll also have to give up my previous experience,and don』t know if I』ll like doing this either.What do I do to not regret my decision?


**Zhishang Career Expert Answer：**


Actually,most people don』t have the sense to do career planning in university.It』s not until you start working that you get to know what kind of job function or industry you may actually enjoy,so don』t be so tough on yourself.You』re quite normal regarding this.


I』ve mentioned it before,I have a Mechanical Engineer degree and worked as an R&D design engineer for the first 5 years of my career,which I also found I didn』t really enjoy.When I decided to pursue a business career,I also felt uncertain and scared about making this change.I didn』t have the new skills I needed,like good communication skills,business sense and several other key soft skills.So I would also need to learn many new things and overcome many new challenges.


But here』s how I viewed my situation.While I』d face many challenges if I made the change,there was also the potential to find something I』d enjoy doing much more.However,if I remained where I was,I saw no possibility of a brighter future.When I saw things in this way,the choice to change became crystal clear.


Btw,I invested nearly 10 years into my engineering career(4 years for my degree and 5½years working),but I had no regrets giving up something I didn』t really enjoy.What you』ll regret is not pursuing something that you believe can make you happier,but didn』t when you had the chance.That,you』ll regret.


From my point of view,you』re young still.Take this change as a challenge.Look forward to learning and doing something new.Be excited about the potential to pursue something that might make you happier.


And if it doesn』t work out,here』s the worst case scenario.You can always go back to your previous job and unsatisfying situation.Trust me,it』ll be there waiting for you,since you』ve already proven you can do it.But I don』t think this will happen.Once you begin your change I believe you』ll enjoy the challenge and potential of your new situation,and you won』t ever want to go back.
