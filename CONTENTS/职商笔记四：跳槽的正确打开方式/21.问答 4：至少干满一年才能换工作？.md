**今日问答：**


我是一名硕士生，目前从事研发工作，可我感觉每天都在做很低端的无用功。我很想辞职，但听说第一份工作至少做一年，写在简历里好看些，对以后也有帮助，我该怎么办?


**职商专家回答：**


在你工作的初期，你会被要求做一些基本的工作。这是，你不得不处理好的现实情况。但是如果你想要担负更大的责任，有更有趣的事情做，那你就需要把它们做好，向别人展示你的能力和潜能。


你说你不喜欢这份工作，但你要确定的是原因是什么。因为你没呆在一个适当的工作环境中？还是因为你一点不喜欢研发工作，选错了职业走向？


比如说，在我工作早期，我也从事研发工作。我喜欢这个公司和我的同事们，但是无论我得到多少的机会和提拔，我就是不喜欢研发工作。我和它一点都合不来，对我来说这是个错误的领域。所以我的情况就不是换工作那么简单了，而是要对我的职业做出一个大的且至关重要的改变。


那你呢？ 你想离开你现在职位的根本原因是什么？在你的公司，你现在所处的工作环境能变得更好吗？有比你更有经验的人么？做事更夺人眼球么？如果是这样的话，那么试着为你自己，更坚持更有耐心地去完成。或者你根本就是在错误的领域，做着错的工作职能？如果是这种情况，那么你就需要去回顾你的整个职业生涯了。


对于第一份工作至少做一年这种说法，任何工作中的一年都是很短的一段时间。因此如果你能避免不满一年就离职这样的情况那是再好不过了。但我更想强调的是，首先你要避免选择不适合你的职业走向。因为即使你辞掉了这份工作，选择了另一份工作，六个月内你可能会发现你也想辞掉这份。


步入良好的工作环境的最重要的因素是，精挑细选，选择好的恰当的机会。你需要认识到，从事任何新工作都是一个巨大的承诺。你不能只是认为「我试试看这个，但如果我不喜欢，我就换掉。」这样的方式将很不利于你的事业和未来发展。


 


**Today' Topic：**


I have a master degree and do R&D work, but actually I feel like what I do is just a low-end job. I want to quit but heard that it』s best to do your first job more than year so your resume looks better. What should I do? 


**Zhishang Career Expert Answer：**


Early in your career, you』re going to be asked to do basic jobs. That』s a reality you just have to deal with. But you need to do them well to show others your capability and potential if you want to be given bigger responsibilities and more interesting things to do.


You say you don't like your job, but you have to determine if it』s because you』re not in the right job situation or because you don't enjoy R&D work in general and are just in the wrong career situation.


For instance, early in my career, I also worked in R&D. I liked the company and people, but no matter how many opportunities or promotions I got, I just didn't enjoy doing R&D work. It was a poor fit and the wrong field for me. So the solution for me was not changing jobs, but making a big, fundamental career change.


What about you? What』s the basic reason you want to leave your current situation? In your company, can the situation you're in now change into something better? Are there others more experienced than you doing things more attractive to you? If so, then try to be more persistent and patient to reach that situation for yourself. Or are you fundamentally in the wrong field or job function? If that』s the case, then you need to relook at your whole career situation.


As for staying in your first job for at least a year, one year in any job is a short amount of time. So it』s better if you can avoid leaving a job within a year. But what I emphasize to people more is to avoid choosing job situations that are a poor fit for you in the first place. Because even if you leave this job and take another one, in 6 months you may find you want to leave that job too.


The most important factor for getting into good job situations is to be more selective and choose good fit opportunities to join. You need to recognize that taking any new job is a big commitment. You can』t just think "I』ll try this, but if I don't like it, I』ll change.」 Such an approach is going to do big damage to your career and future.
