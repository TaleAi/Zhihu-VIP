「要时刻思考，现今取得成功的方式能不能让你在明天也取得成功。」许多年前，当我还是个职场新人时，一位非常成功、非常聪明的高管和导师和我说了这句话。  

  

我从未忘记他的教导。当时，我身处的美国 IT 行业正在经历一些巨大的根本性变化，从硬件为主转变成软件为主，从产品和关系销售为主转变成咨询和解决方案销售为主。  

  

正如他所说，在接下来的三年内，许多多年来业绩出众的销售员同事突然失了业，在市场中不再那么有竞争力。遗憾的是，他们的技能已无法满足该行业的新动态和就业市场的新趋势。


**新经济需要新的技能**


今天，我再次想起导师的这一番话，因为它肯定适用于目前中国正在历经的国家、行业和公司层面的重大转型。就在几年前，中国经济还以劳动密集型产业、制造业和出口为主。现在，其未来的经济将取决于消费者，将以服务和知识为导向。


之前，许多人的职业成功在很大程度上得益于历史性的经济增长。那是一个充满机会的时代，一切都处于快速增长的早期发展阶段。就业市场的基准和标准较少，极其出众的人才竞争较少。可以说很多人都在正确的时间出现在了正确的地方。


如今，中国的增长引擎正在放缓，正在经历另一个重大转型。经济格局的各个方面都变得更加成熟，充满竞争性，人才和就业市场也比以前更透明、更专业、更国际化。  

  

现在仍然有巨大的发展机会，但你必须变得更加强大，才能抓住这些机会。在今天的市场，一切都考实力说话。


**需要更坚固、更有能力**


鉴于这些新现象，你需要知道该具备哪些重要的素质和能力，才能继续成功。我强烈建议你注重以下几方面的素质和能力：


以价值和服务为导向——现在的市场竞争激烈，渠道多样，公司越来越注重为消费者和其他企业提供价值和服务。


**·** **质量——**在许多情况下，价值和服务比拼的就是谁能提供更高的质量


**·** **速度和效率——**除了要保证更好的质量，还要保证能比别人做得更快、更有效


**·** **消费者意识和营销意识——**了解用户需求，让你的产品/服务与众不同，有效地吸引客户，这对于企业的成功至关重要。


**·** **沟通技巧——**随着技术的进步，市场正变得越来越繁忙，信息越来越冗杂，能清楚、简洁、独特地传达信息，确定、接触和吸引他人的人才能取得更大的成功


**·** **更强大的软技能！——**要想培养以上所有素质和能力，在未来取得成功，你必须拥有更强大的软技能！


**今天的改变给你带来更大的机会或困难?**


事实上，任何成功的高管都会告诉你，充满变革的时代也是充满机会的时代。这种变化为每个人创造了新的开始，因为它需要新方法和成功的新模式。新一代的职场人士将走上舞台，填补市场的空缺，这也给你创造了新机会，可以使你更快地取得成功。  

对于固守思维方式和行为方式的人而言，这些新现象会给他们带来巨大的挑战。许多人对周围发生的变化不敏感，难以较快适应。这些新的现实尤其适合年轻专业人士,目前有可能缺乏经验,但饿了,渴望学习新事物,想证明自己。俗话说，「老狗学不会新把戏」。


如今中国将迎来更多的变化，这一轮的变化至关重要。从职业角度看，自我意识更好、更现实、更能改变和学习新事物的人才能继续做出优异表现。如果你正是这种人，那么你将迎来绝佳的成功机遇。


 


**How Pepared Are You To Succeed In China's New Employment Market Realities?**


*「Always consider whether the way you achieve your success today is what will allow you to achieve your success tomorrow.」*This is what a very successful,very wise executive and mentor told me many years ago when I was a young professional.I』ve never forgotten his words.At the time,I was part of the IT industry in the U.S.,which was going through some huge,fundamental changes.It was making a dramatic shift from a hardware-to software-driven industry,and from a primarily product-and relationship-selling to a consultative-and solutions-selling approach.In line with his words,within the next three years,I saw many colleagues who were top sales in the company for many years suddenly out of a job and less competitive in the market.Unfortunately,their skill sets were much less relevant to the new realities of the industry and employment market.


Today,I again think of my mentor』s words,since they certainly apply to this current time of major transformation in China that's happening at the country,industry,and company levels.**Just a few years ago,the emphasis of China』s economy was mainly labor-intensive,and manufacturing-and export-based.Now,its future economic health depends on its ability to move towards being consumer-driven,and service-and knowledge-oriented.**


Previously,the career success of many here was heavily aided by historic growth.It was an opportunistic time,where everything was at an early development,fast-growth stage.Within the employment market,there were fewer benchmarks and standards,as well as less competition for especially strong talent.***You could say many were in the right place at the right time.***


Today,China』s growth engine is slowing and undergoing another significant transition.**Nearly every aspect of the economic landscape is more mature and competitive,while the talent and employment market is now much more transparent,professional,and International-caliber than before.**There』s still growth and great opportunities,but you have to be much more solid to capture them.***In today』s market,you get what you earn.***


Given these new realities,you want to be aware of the key qualities and capabilities that will most impact your ability to continue to be successful.The ones that I highly recommend you pay particular attention to and orient yourself around are:


Being value-and service-oriented–with more competition and channels to choose from,companies care increasingly more about delivering these two things to both consumers and other businesses.


**·** **Quality–**what will differentiate greater value and service in many instances is the delivery of higher quality


**·** **Speed and efficiency–**beyond just delivering better quality is the ability to also deliver it faster than others


**·** **Consumer and marketing sense–**understanding user needs,differentiating your products/services,and being able to effectively engage customers will be essential for the success of any business.


**·** **Communication skills–**as technology advances make the market busier and noisier,those who can identify,reach,and attract others with clear,concise,and unique messages will be the more successful ones.


***·*** ***Stronger soft skills!*****–**to deliver all of the above,all roads to your future success run through your ability build and possess stronger soft skills!


**Actually,any successful executive will tell you that times of big change are also times of big opportunity.The change creates a fresh start for everyone,since new approaches and models of success need to emerge.It allows a new generation of professionals to step into and fill the gaps in the market,which creates new opportunities that can accelerate your ability to achieve your success.**These new realities are toughest for those who are very established in their thinking and way of doing things.For many,they』re just not as nimble to adapt to the changes happening around them.As the saying goes,*「It』s hard to teach an old dog,new tricks.」*


In China today,more change isn』t coming.It』s arrived.And this next round of change is a significant one.**From a career perspective,those who will continue to do well are the ones who are more self-aware,realistic,and able to change as well and learn new things.**If this describes you,then I predict that this is going to be a great time of opportunity and success for you.
