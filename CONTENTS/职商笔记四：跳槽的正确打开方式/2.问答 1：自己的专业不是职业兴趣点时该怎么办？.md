**今日问答：**


自己的专业不是职业兴趣点时该如何调整？我大学刚毕业，但是不想从事与自身专业相关的职业，我现在要怎么做呢？


**职商专家回答：**


和刚毕业的学生交流时，我总是告诉他们不要太在意自己的学历和专业。关于这件事，我有两点要重点强调。


第一件事是，对某些职位和工种来说，你的专业和学历确实很重要。这多半是技术类工种，比如制造业的工程师、金融业的会计、信息技术和电脑编程等。然而依旧有很多很多工作是不需要你的专业对口的。这包括销售、市场、咨询、公关、广告、零售、服务、项目管理、人力资源等多个行业。这些职位更需要你具有一些广义上的能力，而不是专业的技能。


第二件事是，当一个企业想要雇佣刚毕业的大学生来承担基本工作时，他们更注重你是一个怎样的人，而不是你拥有怎样的经验。作为应届毕业生，谁都知道你没什么经验、技能，甚至一些成熟的能力。我们知道在你职业生涯的这个阶段，我们需要在你身上投资，培养你成长。因此，当雇佣应届毕业生时，许多我认识的雇主更注重年轻人身上的活力和冲劲。他们希望寻找积极主动、全面成熟、求知欲强的年轻人。


这就是为什么你会看到许多成功人士做的事和自己的专业毫无关系。例如，这周初我同我的一位员工交谈。她是一位杰出的猎头，但仅仅一年前她还在一所法学校就读。我雇佣她时并未考虑她的学历，而是她的自我意识、成熟、沟通能力、人际交往能力和对成功的渴望深深吸引了我。


总之，在招聘时，雇主要从各种学历背景的人中寻找符合自己要求的候选人，无论是经验符合还是性格符合。而对于雇佣应届生来做基础工作的情况，你是什么样的人往往更为重要。所以将你的注意力聚焦在选择和追求你真正享受的事情上，充满动力地去做吧。你最大的优势就是年轻，你的职业生涯才刚刚开始。你不需要完美地契合你正在追求的东西。至少我认识的大部分雇主都并不在意这一点。


  




**Today'Topic：**


What if I'm not interested in pursuing a job related to my major?I am a recent graduate who realizes now that I don't want to do the job that is related to my major.What should I do?


**Zhishang Career Expert Answer：**


When speaking with recent graduates,I always tell the ones I meet not be overly worried about what kind of degree or expertise you have.There are two main things I'd like to emphasize about this.


The first is that for some positions and job functions,yes,your major or degree matters more.These mainly apply to more technical career tracks,like engineering/manufacturing,accounting/finance,information technology/computer programming,etc.But there are many,many others career tracks and job functions where your major or what you studied really doesn't matter that much.These include positions in sales,marketing,account management,consulting,PR,advertising,retail,customer service,project management,recruitment,talent development,etc.These positions depend much more on the general skill sets you have rather than on a lot of specific experience or expertise.


The second is that for entry level positions,where an employer is hiring fresh or recent graduates,what they're mainly looking for is a type of person,rather than a type of experience.As a fresh graduate,we realize that you don't have much experience,expertise,or even very mature skill sets to offer.We know that at this stage in your career and development,we're going to have to invest in and train you.As a result,when hiring fresh graduates,most employers I know are mainly looking for bright,young things.What they mostly want are people who are self-motivated,well-rounded,and hungry to learn.


That's why you see so many successful people doing well in jobs that aren't related to their major in any way.For instance,on our way to see a client earlier this week,I was talking to one of our outstanding Associate Recruiters who graduated from university with a law degree just before joining our company a year ago.The reason I hired her had nothing to do with her law degree,and everything to do with her self-awareness and maturity,overall communication and people skills,and desire to be outstanding at what we do.


Overall,for any position or in hiring situation,employers are looking to various degrees for a type of experience and a type of person.For entry level roles or when hiring fresh graduates the type of person is even more heavily weighted.So put your attention and energy into choosing and pursuing something that you think you'll enjoy and be highly motivated to do.The best thing going for you is that you're young and just starting out your career!You don't have to be such a perfect fit for what you pursue right now.At least for most employers I know,this is not what we expect or are looking for.
