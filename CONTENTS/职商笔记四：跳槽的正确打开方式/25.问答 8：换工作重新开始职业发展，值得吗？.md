**今日问答：**


我是一个 IT 工程师，我想知道我是否该继续留在现在的公司还是去找一份新工作？我对自己手上的工作太熟悉，感觉不会再有太大进步了。如果我要换工作，那就意味着必须再次重新来过，学习新的技术，接受新的挑战。我该怎么办？


**职商专家回答：**


无论你是个 IT 工程师，还是从事其它工作，你都不能害怕学习新事物，或是接受挑战。尤其是在现在，适应变化的能力是几大成功要素之一，也是任何想要获得事业成功的人需要具备的品质。


我并不是一个 IT 专家，但就你的情况来说，我还是知道，如果你想要成为一个成功的 IT 人士，你需要乐于学习新事物。在制造业、快消或是零售业，生产、分配和销售产品的基本方法多年始终如一。但是，IT 行业并不是这样，因为技术一直在进步。事实是，技术正在以更快的速度发展着。因此，要想保持竞争力，你也需要一直发展新技能，学习新技术。


如果你选择不同公司的类似职位，这或许能帮你摆脱熟悉的环境，但我并不认为这能从长远解决你的问题。这是因为，本质上来说你一直在做重复的事情，或是对你而言太过简单的事情，因此你无法获得成长。


该不该呆在现在的公司，取决于你觉得在这里你的未来是怎样的。比如说，如果你觉得公司能够在另一个部门为你提供很好的机会，你能在那儿做一些更具挑战性或有趣的事情。那么，你很有理由留下来。


总而言之，如果你并不对自己的处境感到高兴，同时想要让自己获得一个更好的环境和未来，那么你就要面对你需要做出改变这个现实。如果你选择继续寻找类似的，让你觉得舒服的环境，那以后你就会在事业上碰到很大的麻烦。或许，这种情况在未来 2 年或是 3-4 年都不会发生，但在未来的某天一定会到来。作为一个 IT 人士，你恰巧处在一个因变化而生的职业和行业。因此，如果你想要在这个领域取得成功，你需要建立类似的思维。


 


换工作重新开始职业发展，值得么？**Today' Topic：**


I』m an IT programmer who wants to know if I should stay in my current company or find a new one? Right now, I』m too familiar with what I』m doing and feel like there』s not much improvement for me. But then I』ll need to change my job, start at the bottom again, learn new technologies and take on new challenges. What should I do?


**Zhishang Career Expert Answer：**


Whether you』re an IT programmer or in any other job function these days, you can』t be afraid to learn new things or take on new challenges. Especially now, the ability to change is one of the top success factors and qualities for any person』s ability to achieve career success today.


Regarding your situation, I'm not an IT expert, but I do know that if you plan to be a successful IT professional, you need to be someone who is willing to learn new things. In industries like manufacturing, consumer products, or retail, the basic approach to producing, distributing, and selling products remains about the same year after year. However, that』s not the case in the IT industry, where technology is constantly evolving. In fact, it』s even doing so at an increasingly faster pace. So to remain competitive in it, you need to also able to continually develop new skills and learn new technologies.


If you stay in the same job situation, but with a different company, this may get you out of your familiar situation, but I don』t think it will solve your problem in the long-term. That』s because fundamentally you』re doing something that』s too repetitive or simple for you, where you feel no growth.


Whether you should stay in your current company or not, that depends on how you feel about your future there. For instance, if you think your company can offer you a good opportunity in another job function or department where you can do something more challenging or interesting to you, then this would be a good reason to stay.


Overall, if you』re unhappy with where you are and want a better situation and future for yourself, then you have to face the fact that you need to make a change. If you choose to continue to just look for something familiar and comfortable to you, then you』re going to face big problems in your career later on. Perhaps this won』t happen in the next two years or even 3-4 years, but definitely in the future. Especially as an IT professional, you happen to be in a job function and industry that』s defined by change. As such, you need to develop a similar mindset if you expect to be successful in this field.
