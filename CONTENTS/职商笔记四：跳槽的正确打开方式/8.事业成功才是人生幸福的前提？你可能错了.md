事实上，我相信大部分人想的刚好跟我的题目是反的。他们会认为——成功的事业，更幸福的生活。也就是说，你事业上的成功将会给你带来更幸福的生活。但我看过太多与此不太一样的例子。我遇到过很多擅长自己事业的人。他们在顶尖公司里爬到了高层的位置，给自己赚到了一个不错的生活水平。他们实现的事情，就是被大多数人称之为事业成功。


**事业的成功并不意味着更幸福的生活**


当你和他们交谈时，的确，很多人对自己的整体状况还是感觉很不错的。但是，其他一些人呢，并没有觉得他们所做的事有多么令人有满足感。他们甚至不太喜欢自己做的事情。他们觉得这只是一份工作，是他们用来谋生的手段而已。他们并不觉得自己所做的事情有什么吸引力，更别说什么激情了。因此，他们既对自己的生活感到不满又对自己的未来感到悲观。年龄越大，这种感觉就越强烈。


但**喜欢自己事业的人往往对生活有更积极的看法。他们在处理事情时更有动力和活力。他们感到更有成就感和满足感。总而言之，这些都对你如何看待自己的生活有很大的影响。**原因如下：


1)**当你不喜欢你所做的事情时，很难真正地享受它。成就感、意义、热情。**你认为这些事情对你在生活中寻找的成功来说很重要吗？如果答案是肯定的，那么对你的事业感到快乐将会是一件很重要的事情。


举个例子吧，我有一个朋友，他有一份不错的工作，而且过的也不错。但是他却不是很享受自己做的事情。不管我们什么时候见面，他总是在抱怨。他会说很多充满负能量的事情。他没怎么说自己在做什么事情，他更多地是在讲，自己希望去做些什么。


做一些你不喜欢的事情会影响你的精神状态、你的态度以及你对生活中许多事物的看法。我是说，**如果你醒着的一半时间都在做一些你并不是那么在意的事情，那么你如何会感到成功呢？** 


2）**看起来好的东西并不总是觉得很好**——这恰恰描述了我的第一份工作。虽然不管怎么看我都不算是公司的大牛，但是我总是能不断升职。所以你也可以说我的事业发展得挺好。


当大家了解我的工作时，他们往往会说:「哇，你在美泰公司工作(全球最大的玩具公司)。」或者，「你以设计玩具而谋生吗？那真是太酷了!」但我其实并没有他们所说的那么快乐。因为我对自己所做的事情并不感兴趣，对自己的生活感到很不快乐。与此相反，我经常感到内心空虚和缺乏灵感。虽然那时我还不成熟，但我知道我的生活不应该这样。我应该为自己的未来感到兴奋。但我没有。


3）**你的职业会影响你对其他事情的看法**——追求并做你喜欢做的事情会彻底改变你对事物的看法。当我开始做我喜欢做的事情时，它改变了我对自己的看法，它改变了我做事的方式，也改变了我为自己寻找的成功的方向。在我的职业生涯中，我感受到的这种更大的成就感影响了我生活的方方面面。我变得更努力，更有目的性地对待我所做的一切。


也许你并不会因为做你最喜欢做的事情而变得很有钱。但是希望你能够赚足够的钱来继续自己想做的事情。同时，你会以其他有意义的方式来衡量你的成功。 


4）**做你喜欢做的事情是获得更大成功的关键**——很多人都恰恰搞反了。当他们看到一个精力充沛、快乐的成功人士时，他们认为成功人士的幸福源于他的成就。能赚很多钱的人是令人尊敬的，他对自己的状态也有更强的控制力。当然，他是快乐的！


但对我认识的大多数成功人士来说，成功的最大原因是他们在做自己真正喜欢的事情。他们更专注、更投入。他们更努力地工作，因为他们想要在所在领域更擅长。想象一下，如果你每天醒来都有类似的感觉，你会有怎样的成就。


**今天的职业选择比以往任何时候都多**


听着，**在你父母的那一代人中，机会和选择的机会要少得多。因此，一个好的职业是唯一的目标**。事实上，在他们的时代去追求更快乐的事业甚至算是轻率和不负责任。没有人敢抱怨他们在做的事。只要有一份稳定的工作来支持他们就足够了。即使你想做些不一样的事情，你还有其他的选择吗？


当然，事业的成功永远是你的首要目标。你需要有能力为你的家庭和未来提供帮助。但是时代变了。我们生活在一个充满成长和机遇的时代。**对于很多人来说，追求并且能够做一些你真心感兴趣的事情是完全在你的能力范围之内的。事实上，如果你想拥有一个成功的事业和生活，你更应该这么做。**


所以简而言之，**在你的职业生涯中不要低估追求幸福的程度会对你的成功产生多大的影响。并且不仅是你事业上的成功，还有你人生的整体成功。**是的，事业的成功往往会带来更快乐的生活。但事实并非总是如此。另一方面，追求更快乐的事业将会帮助你获得更成功的生活，想想那些你认识的，真正享受自己事业的人。


 


**Happier Career,Successful Life**
----------------------------------


Actually,I believe most people will think the opposite.They'll think,Successful Career,Happier Life.That your career success will lead to a happier life.But I've seen too many instances where this isn't necessarily so.I've met many people who are good at what they do.They climb to higher levels in top companies and earn a good living.They achieve the things that most people equate to career success.


 


**A successful career doesn't always lead to a happier life**


When you talk to them,yes,many feel good about their overall situation.But many others I speak to don't find what they do to be very fulfilling.They don't even like what they do that much.It's their job.How they make their living.They don't feel engaged doing what they do,let alone any passion for it.As a result,they don't feel that good about their life or positive about their future either.The older they get the more they feel this way.


But **people who enjoy their career tend to have a much more positive view of things.They're more motivated and energetic in their approach to things.They feel greater fulfillment and satisfaction.These all have a big impact on how you feel about your life,overall.**Here's why. 


1)**Hard to feel good when you don't enjoy what you do**–Fulfillment.Meaning.Passion.Do you believe these are important to the success you seek in life?If so,then feeling happy about your career is going to be quite important. 


For instance,a friend of mine has a good job and makes a good living,but doesn't enjoy what he does.Whenever we get together,he complains a lot.He says a lot of things that are negative.He doesn't talk much about what he's doing.He's always talking about what he wishes he was doing. 


Doing something you don't enjoy affects your state of mind,attitude,and way you feel about many things in your life.I mean,**how do you feel successful if for half your waking hours you're doing something you don't care that much about?**


2)**What looks good doesn't always feel good**–This describes exactly my first job.I wasn't a superstar by any means,but I got regular promotions in the company I worked for.So you could say that my career was going well. 


When people found out what I did,they'd say,「Wow,you work for Mattel(the world's#1 toy company)!」Or,「You design toys for a living?That's so cool!」But I never felt the same way about my situation as they did.Because I had little real interest in what I did,I felt far from happy about my life.Instead,I often felt empty and uninspired.Although I was immature back then,I knew that my life shouldn't feel like this.I should feel excited about my future.But I didn't.


3)**Your career affects how you view other things**-Pursuing and doing what you enjoy completely changes how you view things.When I started doing something I enjoyed,it changed how I viewed myself.It changed how I did things,and the type of success I sought for myself.**This greater fulfillment I felt in my career influenced many other aspects of my life.I became more hardworking and purposeful towards everything I did.**


Perhaps you won't become rich doing what you enjoy most.But hopefully,you'll be successful enough financially doing it.And you'll view and measure your success in other ways that are meaningful to you.


4)**Doing what you enjoy is the key to greater success**-Many people have it backwards.When they see an energetic,happy person who is successful,they think his happiness is a result of his success.The person makes a lot of money,is respected,and has more control over his situation.Of course,he's happy!


But for the most successful people I know,the biggest reason for their success is that they're doing something that they genuinely enjoy.They're more dedicated and engaged.They work harder because they want to become very good at what they do.Imagine what you could achieve if you woke up feeling a similar way each day.


**More career choices are available today than ever before**


Listen,**in your parent's generation,there were far fewer opportunities and choices.So a successful career was the one and only objective.**In fact,pursuing a happier career in their time was even frivolous and irresponsible.Nobody dared to complain about what they were doing.Just having a steady job to support them was enough.Even if you wanted to do something different,what other options were available to you?


Of course,a successful career is always your first objective.You need to be able to provide for your family and future.But times have changed.We live in an amazing time and place of growth and opportunities.**For many people today,pursuing and doing something that you genuinely enjoy is also well within your ability to achieve.In fact,it even makes sense for you to do this if you want to have a more successful career,and life.**


So my simple message is this.**Don't underestimate how much pursuing happiness in your career impacts your success.And not just your career success,but the overall success that you feel towards your life as well.**Yes,a successful career often results in a happier life.But that's not always the case.On the other hand,pursuing a happier career will help you achieve a more successful life,whatever that may be to you.Just think about the people you know who really enjoy what they're doing.
