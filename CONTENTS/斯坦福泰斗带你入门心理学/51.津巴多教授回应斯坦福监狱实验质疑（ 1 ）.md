## 51.津巴多教授回应斯坦福监狱实验质疑（ 1 ）
关注心理学和学术圈的同学，肯定知道最近有一场引发广泛关注的学术风波。这场风波的核心就是大名鼎鼎的心理学实验：斯坦福监狱实验。


 这场争论的重点不仅局限在实验本身，更是牵扯出了一个大问题：心理学研究到底可不可靠？我想，大家不只是看到这个事件的表面争论，只满足于做一个看热闹的围观群众。我更希望大家能够思考一些更深层次的问题：一项符合伦理的心理学研究应该如何开展？研究科学真的只是关起门来「搞研究」这么简单吗？以心理学为代表的社会科学该如何改进自己的研究方法？


 为了让大家更好地了解斯坦福实验的前因后果，以及实验背后承载的心理学话题，我特意从津巴多教授那里取得了第一手回应，并且带领知乎的小伙伴们连夜将其翻译成中文，在接下来的几节课程中连载。


 我相信，你听完这部分内容以后，一定能从斯坦福监狱实验，这个最著名的心理学实验中得到新的启发，不仅对心理学更有信心，还会产生更多兴趣。借用一个心理学从业者的评论：别担心，心理学好着呢！


Zimbardo’s Rebuttal Against Recent Criticisms of the SPE (June 19 , 2018 )


Blogger Ben Blum (online Medium, June 7 , 2018 ) has issued a critical/ hostile diatribe against the authenticity and value of the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, SPE, labeling it all a 「Fraud」 and a 「Lie.」 I hereby challenge both his conclusions and much of the evidence he offers for his spurious assertions. Curiously, other bloggers have also recently presented similar attacks on the SPE: Brian Resnick in VOX (June 14 , 2018 ), 「This damning video debunks the famed experiment.」 Jay Van Bavel in Live SCI=NCE ( June 12 , 2018 ), 「The bottom line is that conformity isn't natural, blind or inevitable.」
A full-length new book by French author, Thibault LeTextier, History of a Lie ( 2018 ), also joins this bandwagon of vocal critics of the SPE.


以下是津巴多教授对斯坦福监狱实验质疑的回应，下文中提到的我皆指代津巴多教授本人。
博客作者 Ben Blum 于 2018 年 6 月 7 日在线上媒体 Medium 上，发表了一篇针对 1971 年斯坦福大学监狱实验，以下简称 SPE ，的真实性和价值的充满批判和敌意，近乎谩骂的文章，将其标为「欺诈」和「谎言」。 这篇回应里，我将反驳他的结论以及他为虚假断言提供的大部分证据。 奇怪的是，最近其他博客也对 SPE 发表过类似的攻击性言论：比如，Brian Resnick 于 2018 年 6 月 14 日在 VOX 节目里说，「这个该死的视频揭穿了这个著名的实验。」 6 月 12 日在 Live SCIENCE 里，Jay Van Bavel 说， 「究其实，从众这事并不是自然的，盲目的或者一定要发」生的。」


此外，法国作家 Thibault LeTextier 的新书《谎言史（ 2018 ）》也加入了批评 SPE 的行列。


I assert that none of these criticisms present any substantial evidence that alters the SPE’s conclusion of the value of understanding how systemic and situational forces can operate to influence individual behavior in negative or positive directions, often without our personal awareness. Its message is a cautionary tale of what might happen to any of us if we are not mindful of these external pressures on our actions.


我在此声明，这些批评都没有提供任何实质性证据可以改变 SPE 的结论，即，其帮助理解系统性和情境性的力量如何在不知不觉中影响我们个人负面或正面行为的价值。 它传递的信息是一个警示故事：即如果我们没有觉察到影响我们行动的这些外部压力，那么可能会发生什么。


What was the Stanford Prison Experiment, and what serendipitous events catapulted this academic experiment about situational power into national prominence? The SPE was a study conducted at Stanford University over six days, August 14-19 , 1971 , designed and conducted by me, as principal investigator, along with my research team of graduate students, Craig Haney and William Curtis Banks, undergraduate David Jaffe, and prison consultant, Carlo Prescott. It was an exploratory investigation of the extent to which the power of situational forces could transform individual behaviors of participants. Twenty-four college students, recruited from a newspaper ad to participate in a study of prison life, were randomly assigned the roles of prisoner and guard. The guards worked 8-hour shifts, while the prisoners lived full time in a mock prison setting created in the basement of the Stanford psychology department. Stanford’s Human Subjects Research Office approved this unique experiment, within the guidelines they provided. The intended two-week experiment was terminated after 6 days because of the unexpectedly extremely negative reactions of many of the mock guards and prisoners. Full details of this study are available in print, The Lucifer Effect ( 2007 ), and on line, [www.PrisonExperiment.org](http://www.PrisonExperiment.org).


什么是斯坦福大学监狱实验，又是哪些偶然事件把这一关于情境力量的学术实验推到了一个举国关注的重要地位？ SPE 是一个在 1971 年 8 月 14 日至 19 日，共计六天的，在斯坦福大学进行的一项研究。由我作为首席研究员进行设计和指导，与我的团队，包括研究生 Craig Haney ，William Curtis Banks ，本科生 David Jaffe ，和监狱顾问 Carlo Prescott ，共同完成的。这是一项探索性调查，旨在研究情境力量能够改变参与者个人行为的程度。从报纸广告中招募的 24 名大学生参加了这项监狱生活研究，并被随机分配了囚犯和狱警的角色。狱警每班工作 8 小时，而囚犯则 24 小时生活在斯坦福心理学系地下室的模拟监狱里。斯坦福大学的人类研究项目办公室批准了这个独特的实验，认定其符合规定。由于这些模拟狱警和囚犯后来发生出乎意料的极端消极的反应，这项预计进行两周的实验在 6 天后被终止。这项研究的全部细节已付梓出版，书名《路西法效应》（ 2007 年）。也可以在[www.PrisonExperiment.org](http://www.PrisonExperiment.org) 上查找到。


Dramatic events erupting in American prisons on the West coast, San Quentin Prison, and on the East coast, Attica Prison, shortly after SPE was ended brought prison conditions into the national limelight. On August 20 , during an alleged escape attempt by Black political prison activist, George Jackson, a number of San Quentin guards and prisoners were killed. From September 9 - 13 , a thousand Attica prisoners took control of that facility in public protest against Jackson’s 「murder.」 That confrontation ended with National Guardsmen killing many of those prisoners as well as their prison guard hostages. Extensive coverage followed by mass media and investigations by various U.S. Congressional committees. I was invited to participate in both TV media events and congressional hearings, which generated considerable interest in what had happened in our mock prison.


在 SPE 结束后不久，西海岸的圣昆廷监狱和东海岸的阿提卡监狱爆发的戏剧性事件使监狱环境成为全国的焦点。 8 月 20 日，在黑人政治活动家 George Jackson 涉嫌逃跑期间，一些圣昆廷狱警和囚犯遇害。 从 9 月 9 日至 13 日，有 1000 名阿提卡囚犯控制了监狱，公开抗议对 Jackson 的「谋杀」。这场对抗最终以国民警卫队杀死了许多囚犯以及他们的狱警人质结束。 媒体进行了广泛的报道，美国国会也组成了相关委员会进行调查。我被邀请参加电视媒体活动和国会听证会，这些听证会也让大众对我们的模拟监狱中发生的事情产生了相当大的兴趣。


Before reviewing the challenges posted against the honest portrayal of the SPE , I feel that it is important to highlight the extent to which I have gone to make every bit of documented information from the SPE publicly available in the archives of Stanford University , as well as in the archives of Akron University’s Museum of Psychology ( donated more than 40 boxes worth of observational data, prisoner/guard/staff reports and diaries that were gathered during and following the study, and the 12 hours of videos made during the SPE ). The Lucifer Effect ( 2007 ) contains 10 chapters devoted to various aspects of the SPE's, with full documentation as to the source of every assertion.


在回顾对 SPE 真相的挑战之前，我觉得很重要的一点是强调我已经在多大程度上使 SPE 每一个细节都在斯坦福大学公开档案中，以及在阿克伦大学心理学博物馆的档案馆中记录在案（捐赠了 40 多箱价值观察数据，在研究期间和之后收集的囚犯/狱警/工作人员的报告和日记，以及 SPE 期间录制的 12 小时视频）。 「路西法效应」（ 2007 年）中有 10 章，专门介绍 SPE 的各个方面，并提供关于每个论断的来源的完整文档。


After confronting these claims regarding the alleged fraudulent nature of the experiment’s process and conclusions, I will detail some of its unique features, its documented scientific validation, and its many real world applications. Finally, I conclude by outlining several of the unexpectedly valuable extensions derived from my SPE experiences and reflections: the pioneering research and therapy for shyness; the innovative research on the psychology of time perspective and its therapeutic applications; and also the development of a new program for inspiring and training youth to become everyday heroes as part of the Heroic Imagination Project. 


在对这些关于实验过程和结论的欺诈性质的说法提出质疑之后，我将详细介绍它的一些独特功能，记录的科学验证以及它的许多现实应用。 最后，我总结了由我的 SPE 经验和思考得出的一些出乎意料的有价值的扩展：对羞怯的开创性研究和治疗; 时间观心理学及其治疗应用的创新研究; 及一个启发和培训年轻人成为日常英雄的新计划的开发，也是「英雄想象项目」的一部分。


I would also like to mention upfront that Blum implies that my prominent place in modern psychology derives primarily from the SPE . However, my reputation derives from considerable research and theories on many topics, prior to 1971’s debut of the SPE , as well as afterwards. Indeed, it was my prior achievements in research and teaching at New York University, which led to the offer to become a tenured full professor of psychology at Stanford University. In addition, it was my earlier work that led me to be invited to co-author one of the leading introductory psychology texts, Psychology and Life. Subsequently, I was chosen from a group of prominent authors to become the creator and narrator of the 26-part TV series, Discovering Psychology, which in recent decades has been viewed by millions of students and teachers around the world. I suspect that my prominence within psychology derives as much from those contributions, if not more so, than it does from the SPE itself. Overall, I have contributed to 40 different areas of psychology, as documented in the more than 60 books and 600 publications that I have written so far.


讨论之前，我还想说一下， Blum 暗示我在现代心理学中的地位主要来自于 SPE 。然而，我的声誉来源于许多主题的大量研究和理论，在 1971 年推出 SPE 之前以及之后都有。事实上，是我在纽约大学研究和教学方面先前取得的成就，使我成为斯坦福大学心理学终身教授。此外，我以前的工作成就，也是使我被邀请合作撰写心理学最重要的入门教材之一《心理学和生活》的原因。后来我从一群知名作家中被选中成为 26 集电视节目《发现心理学》的创作者和解说员。近几十年来，全球已有数百万学生和老师观看了这个节目。我认为对于我在心理学领域的地位的建立，我这些工作的贡献不比 SPE 少 。总的来说，我已经对 40 个不同领域的心理学做出了贡献，也在迄今为止我撰写的 60 多本书和 600 本出版物有所记录 。

Staff instructions to guards to be 「tough,」 biased their behavior and distorted outcomes. The SPE was designed as a mock prison simulating some of the main features that characterized the American prison system at that time. Central in the training of guards was to exercise their power over their prisoners so that they would readily obey orders, prevent rebellion and eliminate escape attempts. My instructions to the guards were that they should maintain law and order, and also command the respect of prisoners. In the power dynamic between them, guards should have most, while prisoners had little or none. We did not give any formal or detailed instructions about how to be an effective guard. 


第一个问题：研究人员指示狱警变得更加「粗暴」，扭曲了他们的行为也影响了实验结果。


SPE 是依照当时美国监狱系统的典型特征而设计的一个模拟监狱。当时狱警训练的核心内容便是对囚犯们行使他们的权力，使囚犯们听从指示，防止他们反抗或尝试逃脱的意图。我当时对于狱警的指示是，他们应该维持纪律与秩序，并且我也要求他们对于囚犯要保持尊重。在他们之间动态的权力关系中，狱警拥有最多权力，而囚犯只有一点点，甚至没有。我们并没有对如何成为一个有效的狱警给予任何正式的，或是具体的指示。


Recall that none of the participants wanted to be given the guard role, but were assigned so randomly. Initially, on day one, none of them were enacting any semblance of a prison guard role; videos show them encouraging prisoners to take the counts seriously, giggling while doing so. One of the three students on that shift was clearly not engaged even in getting the nine prisoners to follow these rather lame orders by the other guards. Viewing this lack of role involvement, David Jaffee, acting as the SPE Warden, took him aside and chastised him for not being a 「tough」guard, in effect not playing out his assigned experimental role. There was never any further specification in how to be 「tough,」 although there was an explicit admonition against any use of physical force. 「React as you imagine Pigs (real prison guards) reacting,」 he suggested. 


请记得当时没有参与者想要被分到狱警的角色，都是被随机分配到的。一开始，在第一天的时候，他们中没有人表现得像一个狱警；视频显示他们曾笑着鼓励囚犯变得更认真一些。那次交接的三个狱警中的一个显然没有参与进来，即使在其他两个狱警让那九个囚犯遵守他们无力的指示时也是一样。David Jaffee ，作为 SPE 的监狱长，看到这个狱警没有真正代入角色，便将他带到一旁并责备他没有成为一个「强硬」的狱警，没有表现得像他所被分配的实验角色。我们从未具体化如何去变得更加「强硬」，并且当时有明确警告禁止使用任何武力。他建议说：「想象你是一个真正的狱警来行动。」


In the beginning, the guards were not acting in a dominant way. However, on the morning of the second day, everything changed when the prisoners rebelled in a variety of ways that erupted in verbal and physical confrontations between them and the full complement of nine guards. After the rebellion was settled, one guard declared that these are 「dangerous prisoners,」 and with that new view of the situation, many guards did become tougher in their actions. 


一开始，狱警们并没有表现得有主导性和支配性。然而，第二天早晨，在囚犯们以多种形式进行反抗并引起了与全体九个狱警的言语及肢体冲突后，一切都改变了。待该次反抗被平复之后，一个狱警声称这些是「危险的囚犯」，而在这种全新的视角下，许多狱警确实变得更加「强硬」了起来。


It is important to note that in all my reports about the SPE, I have always highlighted individual differences among the guards. One or two on each shift became progressively meaner over time, others maintained a more even-tempered role performance, and a few were considered 「good guards」from the prisoners’ perspectives. However, none of the 「good guards」 ever intervened, to minimize or prevent, the cruel behaviors of their fellow guards. Blum acknowledges these individual differences among the guards, 「Most guards gave lackluster performances. Someone went out of their way to do small favors for the prisoners.」 From my perspective, the range of guard behaviors undercuts any criticisms of the alleged demand characteristics that presumably distorted the results of the SPE. Those guards, who did become meaner and creatively cruel toward the prisoners over time, did so of their own initiative. It is their extreme behaviors that have generated the dramatic effects portrayed in this study, most notably those of the iconic guard, 「John Wayne」(presented next).


值得注意的是，在我所有对于 SPE 的报告中，我一直强调狱警中所存在的个体差异。在每次轮班中，会有一两个狱警变得越来越强硬与刻薄，而其他的则继续保持着一个温和的角色扮演，他们中有一些人被囚犯们视为「好狱警」。但是，没有任何一个「好狱警」曾为了减少或阻止其他狱警的残忍行为而进行干涉。Blum 承认了狱警之间的个体差异，「大部分狱警表现得十分平凡。甚至有些狱警会帮助囚犯们做些小事情。」从我的观点来看，这些狱警的行为削弱了对于所谓的需求特征影响 SPE 实验结果的任何批评。这些狱警们是自发地对囚犯们变得越来越刻薄与残忍的。正是他们的这些极端行为引导至了该研究如此戏剧化的效果，包括其中最典型的狱警 —— John Wayne（请见后文）。


A guard was intentionally acting cruel to help make the study work as I had intended. Blum alleges that David Eshelman, nicknamed 「John Wayne」by prisoners because he constantly acted as an out-of-control, Wild West cowboy, was only consciously play-acting the role of tough guard. After the experiment, Eshelman declared that he modeled his role after the warden in the movie, Cool Hand Luke, Struthers Martin. He said he wanted to make the experiment work, so stepped up to lead his night shift to be really tough on the prisoners. He did so by punishing them repeatedly with extensive push-ups (sometimes with other prisoners stepping on their backs) or limiting food access, or issuing arbitrary rules. With each passing night, Eshelman became more creatively evil in ways that went beyond being a tough guard. Indeed, he later said that he began to think of himself as a 「puppeteer」 who made prisoners do whatever he chose. In an extreme perversion of his experimentally assigned role, Eshelman devised an unthinkable way to humiliate all prisoners on the fifth night of the study. He ordered them to think of themselves as 「camels,」half as males and the other half as females. Those ordered to be female camels had to bend over, while the male camel prisoners were ordered to 「hump」 them 「doggy style,」 which they reluctantly did by simulating sodomy. Our video recording, made in my absence, indicated this went on for nearly ten minutes with all three guards shouting epithets and laughing hysterically. Fortunately, I had earlier decided to terminate the experiment the next morning. 


第二个问题，一个狱警有意表现得更为残忍来使实验符合我的预期。


 Blum 声称 David Eshelman ，一个因一直表现得像一个疯狂失控的西部牛仔而被囚犯们绰号为「ohn Wayne」的狱警，仅仅是有意地饰演强硬狱警的角色。在实验之后，Eshelman 声称他是以电影 Cool Hand Luke 中的监狱长 Struthers Martin 为蓝本来塑造他自己的角色的。他说他想让实验更加成功，于是在每次轮夜班时都会对囚犯们十分强硬。他让囚犯们一直做俯卧撑（有时让其他囚犯踩在他们的背上），限制他们的饮食，并肆意制定规矩。每晚，Eshelman 都会以极有「创意」的方式变得越来越残忍，远远超出了一个强硬狱警的界限。确实，他后来说他开始自认为是一个「玩偶师」，操控着囚犯们做任何他想做的事情。极度滥用他的角色权力，Eshelman 在实验的第五天想出了一个不可想象的方式来羞辱所有的囚犯。他命令他们将自己想象为「骆驼」，一半囚犯被分为雄性，另外一半被分为雌性。那些被分为雌性的「骆驼」们需要弯腰，而那些雄性的「骆驼」囚犯们则被命令以「狗趴式」与他们「性交」，他们非常不情愿地模拟着鸡奸行为。在我缺席时所录制的视频显示该事件持续了大约 10 分钟，所有三个狱警都喊着辱骂性的称号，歇斯底里地笑着。幸好，我先前已经决定在第二天早晨终止这次实验。


I think it goes without saying that such actions go way beyond simply playing the assumed role of acting the 「tough guard.」 It is also worth noting that Eshelman's fellow guards fully participated in these activities and other offensive behaviors that typified their shift—activities that were strikingly similar to the sexual degradation rituals imposed on Iraqi prisoners by American prison guards in Abu Ghraib Prison. The night shift was not alone in excessively brutalizing the SPE prisoners; several guards on the other two shifts also regularly engaged in humiliating and degrading assignments designed to show the prisoners the extent of their newfound guard power. Was the experience of being an SPE guard a 「sham,」 in a fraudulent study, as Blum and other critics are contending? The full body of available evidence clearly suggests not.


毋庸置疑，这种行为远远超出了所谓「强硬」的狱警所应该扮演的角色。值得一提的是，与 Eshelman 同班的其他狱警们都全全参与了这些使他们的轮班具有特征性，有攻击性的活动——这些活动与美国狱警在阿布格莱布监狱（ Abu Ghraib Prison ）对伊拉克囚犯所作出的有关性侮辱的仪式十分的相似。而并不仅仅是这一夜班过分地残忍对待 SPE 的囚犯们；在其他几班中，也有几个狱警频繁涉及羞辱、**\*\*\*\***贬低囚犯们的活动****中，以示囚犯们狱警所具有的权力。在 SPE 中作为一个狱\*\*\*\*****警的经历真的如 Blum 和其他批评者所声称，是在一个有诈骗性质的研究当中「作假」的经历嘛？所有可用的证据都表明并不是。


以上是津巴多教授回应的第一部分，我们下节课继续连载，祝你度过充实的一天。
