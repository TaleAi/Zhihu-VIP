## 74.津巴多：找到行动背后的「动力引擎」
Philip Zimbardo, Chapter 11 , Psychology and life. Here in this chapter on Motivation, the problem I faced was what to include and what to exclude. Since motivation covers everything that drives us to do what we do and also to decide what we not do. I decide to limit the content of this chapter to three domains, the psychology of eating, the psychology of sexual behavior and the psychology of personal achievement. Coming from an Italian background, where good food and good wine and family friendships around meals are essentials, I had to give this section some promise where it is obvious that many students want to learn more about sexual motivation, sexual behavior, sexual desire and sexual norms, which vary quite differently from culture to culture. Finally many students also want to learn how to succeed in life, notably in the choices of work settings to make a living. So I ended this chapter outlining what we know about the new domains of work and organizational psychology. 


在本章关于动机的内容中，我面临的问题是本章该讲什么，省略什么。 因为动机涵盖了驱动我们做所有做的事，也决定了我们不去做什么事。 我决定将本章的内容限制在三个领域，即饮食心理学，性行为心理学和个人成就心理学。 我自己有来自意大利的家庭背景，那么美食、美酒，和围绕着美食的家庭与友谊是必不可少的。不过我也得给大家一些念想，因为很明显，许多学生想要更多地了解性动机、性行为、性欲和性规范，而这些在不同文化之间差异很大。 最后，许多学生还想学习如何在生活中取得成功，特别是在选择正确的工作环境来谋生这一方面。 所以我在本章结束时，概述了我们在工作与组织心理学方面的新见解。
