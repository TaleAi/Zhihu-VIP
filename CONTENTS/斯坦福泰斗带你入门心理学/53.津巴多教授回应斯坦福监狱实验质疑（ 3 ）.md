## 53.津巴多教授回应斯坦福监狱实验质疑（ 3 ）
Coming next are sections highlighting what is unique about the SPE; what are its scientific and conceptual validations; how it has influenced decisions in legal settings; how the U.S. military has applied one of its main conclusions, and then we turn to reflect on three of its most enduring positive extensions in the domains of shyness, time perspective, and heroism.


接下来将重点介绍 SPE 的独特之处;它的科学和概念性的验证是什么?它如何影响法律环境中的决定;美国军队是如何运用其中的一个主要结论的，然后我们开始思考它在害羞、时间观心理学和英雄主义领域的三个最持久的积极延伸。


Uniqueness of the SPE


The design of the SPE is unique in social psychological research by enabling observations of behavior patterns of the participants during an extended period of more than 120 hours. One of its main conclusions is that participants who were randomly assigned to roles of prisoner or guard, gradually assumed those new identities in a simulated prison setting despite their awareness of its experimental nature. Most other research is typically compressed into a one-hour session, so it is not possible to observe the emergence of situated identities, such as some normal, healthy college students becoming either cruel guards or helpless prisoners. 


****SPE的独特性****


 SPE 的设计在社会心理学研究中是独一无二的，它可以观察参与者在超过 120 小时的时间内的行为模式。它的主要结论之一是，参与者被随机分配到囚犯或看守的角色，尽管他们意识到这些新身份具有实验性质，但是，他们在模拟监狱环境中逐渐获得这些新身份。大多数其他的研究通常被压缩成一个小时的时长，所以不可能观察到特定身份的出现，比如一些正常、健康的大学生变成了残忍的狱警或无助的囚犯。


Scientific Validation


Replication with variations by independent researchers is the hallmark of all experimental research, and so it was with the SPE . A team of researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia extended the SPE design by having one condition similar to ours and several other experimental variants to explore how social organizations influence the relationship between prisoners and guards (Lovibond, Mithiran, & Adams, 1979). Their 「Standard Custodial」 regime was modeled on medium security prisons in Australia and was closest in its procedure to the SPE. The researchers' central conclusion of their rigorous experimental protocol notes: 「Our results thus support the major conclusion of Zimbardo et al. that hostile, confrontive relations in prisons result primarily from the nature of the prison regime, rather than the personal characteristics of inmates and officers.」 (pp. 283). These results, within this research design, also help offset skepticism about the validity of such simulation experiments by providing baselines to assess behavioral changes from objectively defined structural characteristics of real-life prisons.


****科学验证****


由独立研究人员进行的可变性复制是所有实验研究的标志，SPE 也是如此。澳大利亚新南威尔士大学( University of New South Wales , Australia )的一个研究小组扩大了 SPE 设计，采用了一种类似于我们的条件和其他几个实验变量，以探究社会组织如何影响囚犯和狱警之间的关系( Lovibond, Mithiran， & Adams , 1979 )。他们的「标准监管」制度模仿了澳大利亚的中等安全程度的监狱，在程序上最接近 SPE 。研究人员对严格的实验协议的核心结论是:「因此，我们的研究结果支持 Zimbardo 等人的主要结论。监狱中敌对的、对抗的关系主要源于监狱制度的性质，而非囚犯和官员的个人特征。」( 283 页)。在这个研究设计中的结果，通过提供基准线来评估客观定义的真实监狱生活的结构特征的行为变化，也有助于消除对这种模拟实验有效性的怀疑。


Conceptual Validation: The Mock Psychiatric Ward as SPE for Staff
Consulting with research director, Norma Jean Orlando, I advised on how it would be possible to create a mock psychiatric ward in Elgin State Mental Hospital in Illinois, where 29 staff members played the roles of mental patients on a locked ward for 3 days and nights. Twenty-two regular staff played their usual roles, while trained observers and video recordings reported on all that transpired. In a short time, most mock patients began behaving in ways that were indistinguishable from real patients: six tried to escape, two withdrew into themselves, others were totally silent, two wept uncontrollably, another came close to having a nervous breakdown, and the majority reported feeling 「incarcerated」with no one caring about their well-being. One staff member-turned- patient who suffered during the weekend ordeal gained enough insight to declare: 「 I used to look at the patients as if they were a bunch of animals; I never knew what they were going through before.」 The positive outcome of this experience was the formation of a committee of staff members working cooperatively with current and former patients who were dedicated to raising consciousness of hospital personnel about the way patients were being mistreated and how they had to change their behavior to create a more constructive, humane environment. (Orlando, 1973 ).


****概念验证: 像 SPE 一样，员工参与到模拟精神病病房****


我咨询了研究主任 Norma Jean Orlando ，就如何在伊利诺伊州埃尔金州立精神病院( Elgin State Mental Hospital )建立一个模拟精神病院提出了建议, 29 名工作人员在一间锁着的病房里扮演精神病人的角色，时间为 3 天 3 夜。 22 名普通工作人员扮演了他们通常的角色，训练有素的观察员和录像记录了所有发生的情况。在很短的时间内,大多数模拟病人开始行为方式,与真正的病人是没有区别的 : 六个人试图逃跑,两个又重新做回自己,其他人是完全沉默,两个人失声痛哭，另一个有点近似精神崩溃,大多数表示感到被「监禁」,而且没有人关心他们的状况。一名在周末受尽折磨的员工变成了病人，他觉得自己已经获得了足够的洞察而宣称:「我过去常常把病人当作一群动物看待，我从不知道他们以前经历过什么。」这个实验能带来的积极成果，是委员会的建立，委员会的员工与现在和之前的病人一同努力，致力于医院员工建立起对于病人受到不公对待的意识，以及他们必须改变行为，创建一个更具建设性的,有人文气息的环境。
( Orlando , 1973 )。


The Enduring Value of SPE’s Message in Legal Settings
I have spent much of my professional career trying to bridge the translation of research findings into social change efforts that promote social justice and what is best in human nature. In their hearings on prison reform (October, 1971 ) the Subcommittee of the United States Congress House of Representatives wanted not only my analyses, but also recommendations for reform. In my statement in the Congressional Record, I clearly advocated congressional intervention into the prison structure to bring about improvements in the condition of inmates, as well as for correctional personnel. 


 ****SPE’s 信息在法律中的持久的价值****


我花了大部分的职业生涯来把学术发现变成社会变革的努力，进而提升社会公平，并搭建由此到人性中最善处之间的桥梁。在他们关于监狱改革的听证会上( 1971 年 10 月)，美国国会众议院的小组委员会不仅仅想要的是我的分析，也包括对改革的建议。在国会记录中，我的陈述里，我明确呼吁对于监狱结构进行国会干预，以改善被收容者和教改人员的处境。


In addition, I wish to highlight the important contributions that Craig Haney has made as a legal scholar to improve prison conditions and in challenging the death penalty. Craig went on in his education after receiving a Ph.D. in psychology to earn an LL.D. from Stanford’s Law School.


另外，我希望强调下 Craig Haney 作为一名法律学者，他在改善监狱条件和挑战死刑方面所做的重要贡献。Craig 在获得心理学 Ph.D 后，又从斯坦福法学院获得了 LL.D 。


Unfortunately, blogger Blum’s Medium critique totally misrepresents what is published testimony in the Congressional Record about my constructive arguments for improving our nation’s mass incarceration system. My advocacy has largely taken the form of consciousness-raising about the necessity for ending the 「social experiment」 of prisons because, as measured by high rates of recidivism, and current mass levels of incarceration in the United States, that experiment has failed. We must find the reason for that through more thorough systems analyses, and propose alternative solutions to incarceration. 


不幸的是，博主 Blum 在 Medium 上的批评彻底误读了已公开的我之前在国会听证上关于提升我们大规模监禁系统的建设性意见的证词。我提倡终止关于监狱的「社会实验」的必要性的意识觉醒，是因为用美国居高不下的重犯率和目前大规模的服刑率来衡量的话，那个实验是失败的。我们必须用更彻底的系统分析来支持监禁的合法性，并提出监禁的替代方案。


My second testimony before a Congressional subcommittee that focused on juvenile detention (September, 1973 ) moved me further toward becoming a social advocate. I outlined 19 separate recommendations for improved treatment of detained juveniles. I was pleased to learn that a new federal law was passed that was in part stimulated by my testimony. Senator Birch Bayh, who headed this investigation, helped to put into law the rule that, to prevent juveniles being abused, juveniles in pre-trial detention should not be housed with adults in federal prisons. 


我在国会委员会做的关于青少年拘禁第二组证词 ( September , 1973 ) 让我进一步变成了社会积极分子。 我列举了 19 条关于提升被拘禁的青少年的待遇的独立建议。一项新的联邦法律被通过了，一部分原因是因为我的证词的带动，对此我深感安慰。参议员 Birch Bayh 主导了这次调查，并协助将新的规定写入法律：为了防止青少年被虐待，在审判前被拘禁的青少年不应被与成年人一同拘禁在联邦监狱中。


One powerful legal impact of the SPE derived from my participation in the 
Federal Court trial of Spain et al. versus Procunier et al. ( 1973 ). The 「San Quentin 
Six」prisoners had been isolated in solitary confinement for over three years for their alleged involvement in the murder of guards and informer prisoners during the escape attempt of George Jackson on August 21 , 1971 . As an expert witness, I toured the facilities of San Quentin's maximum adjustment center and interviewed each of the six prisoners a number of times. My prepared statement and two days of trial testimony concluded with the opinion that all of these prison conditions of involuntary, prolonged, indefinite confinement under dehumanizing conditions constitutes, 「cruel and unusual punishment」and must therefore be changed. The Court arrived at a similar conclusion and ordered improved living conditions for inmates. In addition, I served throughout the trial as a psychological consultant to the team of lawyers for the plaintiffs. 


因为我参与了联邦法院关于 Spain 等人 vs Procunier 等人的审判（ 1973 ）， SPE 还对司法产生的深远的影响。「圣昆汀囚犯六人组」，因为在 1971 年 8 月 21 日 George Jackson 的越狱行为中，被认为参与了对狱警和告密囚犯的谋杀，被单独监禁超过三年。作为专家证人， 我拜访了圣昆汀的重罪囚禁中心，并对这六位囚犯分别进行了数次访谈。我准备的陈述和在那两天的证词得出的观点是：所有在反人类环境下的非自愿的、过久的、无限期的监禁带来的「残忍和反常规的惩罚」必须被改变。法院得出了类似的结论，并责令提高重犯的生存条件。此外，我在此次审判中担任了原告律师团的心理顾问。


Later, in 2004 , I was asked to be an expert witness in the military trial of American prison guard Staff Sgt. Chip Frederick. He was a leader of the guards on the night shift in Abu Ghraib prison, all of whom participated in brutalizing Iraqi Prisoners. There were many apparent similarities between the incidents of prisoner abuse by the guards in both prisons – Abu Ghraib and SPE. Frederick’s behaviors were shown to be completely atypical, as he had no prior history of such harmful actions towards any other people. Although he admitted his guilt in committing these abuses in Abu Ghraib, his prison sentence was reduced by the judge’s acknowledgement of the power of that unusual prison situation.
 2004 年，我受邀担任美国狱警 Staff Sgt. Chip Frederick 的军事审判的专家证人。他是 Abu Ghraib 监狱的夜班领导，而他所在的整个班组都参与了对伊拉克囚犯的虐待。Abu Ghraib 和 SPE 的狱警虐待犯人事件有许多显而易见的相似点。Frederick 的行为是完全反典型的，因为他在此前完全没有对他人有任何伤害行为。虽然他承认了自己在 Abu Ghraib 监狱虐待囚犯的行为，法官因为有了非常规监狱中权利滥用现象的认知，减轻了他的服刑期。


Interestingly, I was also asked to be an expert witness in the federal trial of Alex Blum , the cousin of Ben Blum, who mentions him in his Medium blog. Briefly, Alex was a guilty party as get-away driver in a bank robbery along with three other U.S. Rangers. Alex had long obsessed about becoming a U.S. Ranger, and as a recruit, he was assigned to an officer, Luke Elliot Sommer, who was his taskmaster who issued orders to be obeyed without question. One of them was to assist in a 「practice drill」 of robbing a local bank, but in fact, it turned out to be a full-scale bank robbery. I spent enough personal time with Alex to realize the extent to which he was 「blindly obeying his authority」 Capt. Sommer ( who got a 24-year prison sentence ). Alex might have received a similar long sentence, but instead it was reduced to only 16 months, presumably because the court accepted my testimony on that point. When in prison, it took Alex a full eight months to come to the realization that what he had done was a real bank robbery and not a ranger drill, which for me demonstrated the power of his 「Ranger-Mind Set」 of total obedience to his assigned authority. It was a powerful combination of Milgram’s obedience scenario along with cult-leader mind control, as seen in the Jonestown followers of Jim Jones, and those of Rev. Moon. For valuable information on mind control, see Steven Hassan’s Combatting Cult Mind Control ( 2015 ).


有趣的是，我也是 Ben Blum 在 Medium 的博客中所提到的他的表兄 Alex Blum 案联邦审判的专家证人。Alex 作为逃逸车辆的司机和另外三位美国游骑兵一同参与了一起银行抢劫案。Alex 一直有成为一名游骑兵的夙愿，作为一名预备兵，他被指派在军官 Luke Elliot Sommer麾下，并必须无条件服从他的指挥。他收到的其中一项指令便是配合这次抢劫银行「演习」，事实上，这是一次真刀真枪的银行劫案。我与 Alex 进行足够时长的私下交流后，意识到他在「无条件服从权威」思想上受到的影响。Sommer 被判拘禁 24 年，而 Alex ，可以推测，因为法院听取了我的证词，没有获得相似年限的判刑，只被判了 16 个月的监禁。在狱中，Alex 花了整整 8 个月的时间才意识到自己参与的是真实的抢劫，而不是「军事演习」，对我而言，这展示了他无条件服从权威的「游骑兵思维」的影响力。正如琼斯镇事件的追随者和 Moon 牧师追随者身上看到的那样，这是米尔格拉姆的顺从实验场景与邪教领袖精神控制的有力结合。 有关精神控制的更多宝贵信息，请参阅 Steven Hassan 的「与邪教的精神控制做斗争」( 2015 )。


Situationally-Based Behavioral Explanations are Never Forms of 「Excusiology」
「What social psychology has given to an understanding of human nature is the discovery that forces larger than ourselves determine our mental life and our actions – – chief among these forces is the power of the social situation.」 (Banaji, 2001 , Psychological Science Agenda ). 


基于情境的行为解释决不是 「找借口大法」 的形式,「社会心理学对人性的理解的是，发现比我们自身更大的力量决定了我们的心理生活和我们的行为 —— 这些力量中的主要力量就是社会情境的力量。」 ( Banaji , 2001 , 心理科学事项)


However, it should be made crystal-clear that when social psychologists attempt to explain the behavior of individuals in terms of influential external situational forces, they are never implying that personal responsibility is absolved. People are always responsible for the consequences of their actions -- personally, socially and legally. Understanding why we do something does not excuse our liability for the outcomes of that behavior. 


然而，应该清楚地表明，当社会心理学家试图用影响力的外部情境力量来解释个人的行为时，他们绝不是在暗示个人责任是可以免除的。 人永远应该对自己行为的后果负责 ——个人，社会和法律上都是。了解我们行为的成因并不是我们对该行为结果逃避责任的理由。


Nevertheless, some critics of the SPE display a naïve misunderstanding of this perspective by claiming that a message of the SPE is that 「individuals cannot really be held accountable for the sometimes-reprehensible things we do . . . it is also profoundly liberating. It means we're off the hook」 ( Blum , 2018 ). Similarly, LeTextier ( 2018 ) proclaims 「It’s like, ‘Oh my god, I could be a Nazi myself. I thought I was a good guy, and now I discover that I could be this monster.’ And in the meantime, it’s quite reassuring, because if I become a monster, it’s not because deep inside me I am the devil, it’s because of the situation. I think that’s why the (SPE) experiment was so famous in Germany and Eastern Europe. You don’t feel guilty. ‘Oh, okay, it was the situation. We are all good guys. No problem. It’s just the situation made us do it.’ So it’s shocking, but at the same time it’s reassuring.」 Recall that such a viewpoint was rejected in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi doctors and others many decades ago; they were indeed held accountable for the atrocities they committed while 「just doing their job.」


然而，SPE 的一些批评者对这种观点表现出天真的误解，声称 SPE 传达了「个人不能真正对其所做的有时应受谴责的事情承担责任」的观点......这真是深度解放。这意味着我们摆脱了束缚（ Blum ，2018 ）。同样，LeTextier（ 2018 ）宣称：「就像：我的天啊，我可能是纳粹分子 。我一直觉得自己是个好人，现在我发现我也可以是个怪物。同时，这很让人放下思想包袱，因为如果我变成怪物，这并不是因为我内心深处是个魔鬼，而是情境的缘故。我认为这就是为什么 SPE 在德国和东欧如此出名的原因。你不会感到内疚： 哦，好吧，这是情境的作用。我们都是好人，没问题，是环境把我们变成这样的。这是令人震惊的，但同时也令人宽慰。」 回想几十年前在纳粹医生和其他人的纽伦堡审判中，这样的观点被否定了;他们确实为他们在「只是在做他们的工作」时所犯下的暴行付出了代价。


I strongly reject the criticism that the underlying message of the SPE is to absolve people of their 「sins.」 Changing or preventing undesirable behavior of individuals or groups requires an understanding of what strengths, virtues and also vulnerabilities that they bring into any given situation. We need to recognize more fully the complex of situational forces that are operative in given behavioral settings. Modifying them, or learning to avoid them, can have a greater impact on reducing undesirable individual reactions than remedial actions directed only at changing the people in the situation after they have done wrong. That means adopting a public health approach in place of the standard medical model approach to curing individual ills and wrongs. I have stated repeatedly that attempting to understand the situational and systemic contributions to any individual's behavior does not excuse the person or absolve him or her from responsibility in engaging in immoral, illegal or evil deeds. Furthermore, I've always endorsed all efforts to create conditions, systemic and social, that can bring out the best in human nature.


我强烈反对将 SPE 传递的信息理解为「人可以为自己的罪恶开脱」的批评观点。改变或防止个人或群体的不良行为需要了解人在各种特定情况下展现出来的力量、美德和脆弱性。我们需要更全面地认识在特定行为背景下运作的情境力量的复杂性。相比错误发生之后的补救，提前纠正和预防这些行为的发生，更有益于减少不良的个体反应。这意味着采用公共卫生措施取代标准的医疗模式方法来治疗个体的弊病。我多次表示，试图理解情境和系统因素对个体的影响，并不意味着人可以对自己的不道德，非法或邪恶行为免除责任。更进一步说，我一直赞同创造系统性和社会性的条件，来引出人性中最好的一面所进行的所有努力。


Military Use of SPE in SERE Trainings


When I lectured at the United States Naval Academy, I was informed that the Navy and other military units train their personnel using the documentary footage of the SPE to avoid the excesses that are likely to occur during these exercises. Following the Korean War, where some airmen were alleged to have given actionable information to the enemy, our military developed a policy of never giving any information when captured by any enemy, other than name, rank and serial number. The military instituted war games in which some personnel acted as escaped prisoners who were hunted down by other staff, and then interrogated as intensely as possible in order to break them down into giving confessions and vital information. 


****SPE实验在SERE培训中的军事应用****


我在美国海军学院( United States Naval Academy )演讲的时候得知，海军和其他军事单位会把 SPE 的纪录片片段用于人员培训，以避免演习中出现过激行为。朝鲜战争之后，部分飞行员被指控向敌人提供了部分执行机密。于是，军队制定了一项政策，即士兵一旦被敌人捕获，除了姓名、军衔和序列号以外，不得透露任何信息。军队为此还创立了战争模拟游戏，在游戏中，一些士兵会扮演被其他工作人员追捕的在逃囚犯，并接受极为严厉的审讯，通过审讯攻破他们的抵抗，逼迫他们坦白，并获取重要信息。


This program, Search, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE) continues to function as one effective training program to achieve the desired objective of never complying with any enemy commands for information. However, there have been reports of excesses practiced by the simulating interrogators, which were dangerous to the well-being of the simulating captives. The SPE is shown as a warning of the ease in which anyone can cross the line from play-acting to becoming cruel torturers. I found this to be an unexpected outcome of some of SPE’s messages in real-world settings.


这个战争模拟游戏名为「搜索，躲避，抵抗，逃脱 ( SERE )」，一直被用做军队的现行训练项目，以训练士兵达到目标要求：永不屈服，不让敌人获取任何信息。然而，有人报告称模拟审讯人员的操作行为过激，对模拟俘虏的身心健康十分危险。因此，SPE 实验的纪录片可用于警示审讯人员：任何人都可能在游戏中跨越界限，变成残酷的虐待者。我认为这是SPE实验能为真实社会带来的意外用途。


SPE as Pirandellian Prison


Despite Blum’s criticism that I published an early article about the SPE in the New York Times Magazine ( 1973 ), I did so primarily to bring this phenomenon to the attention of a broad general public and not limit it to academics only. 


****SPE：皮兰德娄风格的监狱****


（注：Luigi Pirandello 皮兰德娄，意大利小说家，风格以怪诞、荒唐、真实著称。）
早期，我曾在《纽约时报》( 1973 ) 上发表过关于 SPE 实验的文章。尽管布卢姆因此而批评我，但我这么做的主要目的，是让公众关注到这一现象，让关注不仅仅局限于学术界。


SPE was a drama that was enacted by boys playing their assigned roles without scripted lines and without an audience for hours and days on end. Everyone knew it was only a play. Therefore, I valued the idea of framing the SPE in terms of playwright Luigi Pirandello's metaphors of the thin line between reality and illusion, between acting and being, between role-playing and the role becoming the self. Everyone knew it was just a psychology experiment; that they were in the basement of the psych department, not a real prison; that the prisoners had not committed any crimes; that the guards could have earned their salary by simply playing cards in their guard office for much of their 8-hour shift as long as they kept prisoners locked in their cells. But in a relatively short time frame, the psychology study became a 「prison」 – and the only two ways out of that dungeon were to be released by the arbitrary decision of the parole board or by becoming/acting seriously disturbed mentally or physically (as four others of them did, in addition to prisoner 8612 ).


 SPE 是一部由一群男孩扮演的戏剧，他们没有剧本，没有台词，连续数小时、数天没有观众。大家都知道那只是一出戏剧。因此，我认为剧作家路伊吉•皮兰德娄( Luigi Pirandello )的描述极为精准，即现实与幻觉、表演与真实、角色扮演与角色成为自我，这之间的界限往往十分微妙。大家都知道这只是一个心理学实验; 他们住在精神科的地下室里，而不是真正的监狱; 他们都没有犯过罪; 狱警们只要把囚犯锁在牢房里，在狱警室里打牌，就可以按照 8小时轮班的形式挣到薪水。但在相对较短的时间内，这个心理学实验变成了「监狱」——逃离地牢的方式只有两种：假释委员会宣布释放，或者，患有/假装患有严重的精神或身体疾病（比如囚犯 8612 ，和其他四位囚犯）。


As is also apparent from our documentary videos and verbatim transcripts, not only did most of the research participants enact their roles as if they were imprisoned or were doing their job as paid guards, but almost everyone else who got engaged in that setting acted as if it were a real prison. The prime example is the Catholic priest who I had invited to evaluate the fit of this experiment with his experience in real prisons. He did so by interviewing all the prisoners. However, he soon got into the role of prisoner consoler, calling a prisoner’s mother to inform her that her son needed a public defender to help get him out of this prison. The public defender also knew SPE was just an experiment, but when meeting with the desperate prisoners, he maintained his aloof role that was legally limited to what he could do to help them. 


从视频纪录和文字纪录来看，不仅大部分实验人员都认真地扮演了角色：就好像他们真的被监禁，或者真的是带薪狱警。而且，几乎每个参与者都用行动表明，这好像是一个真正的监狱。最典型的例子是天主教神父，我邀请他用他在真正监狱里的经历来评估这个实验的情况。他采访了所有的囚犯。然而，他很快就成为了「囚犯安慰者」——他打电话给一个囚犯的母亲，告诉她，她的儿子需要一名公设辩护律师帮助他出狱。这位公设辩护律师也知道 SPE 只是一个实验，但当他与绝望的囚犯会面时，他仍然保持着自己在法律层面的客观角色，来尽可能地帮助他们。


Carlo Prescott got so totally into his role as head of the parole board that he began to chastise and verbally abuse many of those pleading to be paroled, until some cried and begged for his understanding of their case. He later said that he had unconsciously become the kind of person he had hated most in the world, the parole board authorities that had turned down his own requests dozens of times before. Afterwards, he reported becoming sick to his stomach, realizing what he had become, and he did not want to play that role ever again. 


Carlo Prescott 也完全沉浸在假释委员会委员长的角色中，以至于他开始惩罚和言语虐待许多请求被赦免的囚犯。直到一些囚犯哭着乞求他理解自己的处境。后来，他说自己不知不觉地变成了自己曾经最讨厌的模样，因为假释委员会也曾多次过拒绝了他的请求。后来，他报告说自己常因为发现自己变成了这样而感到反胃，而且他再也不想扮演那个角色了。


And then there was me. I began the study as the principal research investigator, in charge of my team of students, all interested in exploring together the dynamics of the unique situation we had created. I had initially instituted observational and research protocols, video recording assignments, and data collection procedures, as all experimental researchers do. However, over a very short time, I was transformed into the full-time role of Prison Superintendent. That is the major flaw in the SPE, of failing to maintain an independent scientific observer of the unfolding events. My agenda was less about data collection than it was daily staff assignments, timing of meals, meeting with concerned parents, parole board sessions, guard shift changes, meeting with the prisoner grievance committee, dealing with prisoner breakdowns, and more. 


然后是我。我以首席研究调查员的身份参与了这项实验。我主要负责我的学生团队，他们都非常有兴趣共同研究我们创造的独特环境背后的动机。正如所有的实验研究人员一样，我最初也为这项实验制定了观察和研究协议、录像作业和数据收集程序。然而，在很短的时间里，我变成了一个全职的监狱管理者。这是 SPE 实验的主要缺陷，即人们没有在尚未开展的实验中保持独立的科学观察者身份。而我的日程安排，与其说是收集实验数据，不如说是安排日常工作人员、记录用餐时间、与担忧的父母会面、参加假释委员会会议、安排狱警轮岗、与囚犯申诉委员会会面、处理囚犯事故等等。


Similarly, on Thursday night, five days into the study, there was the usual 10:00 pm scheduled toilet run, the last time prisoners could go to a regular toilet rather than urinate or defecate in buckets in their cells. The night shift guards used this as an opportunity to torment and confuse the prisoners in various ways. At this point, I no longer acknowledged the suffering of the prisoners; it was only a checkmark on my daily schedule, of the planned toilet run going on as usual. 


随后，在一个周四晚上，也就是研究开始的第五天，在每天晚上 10 点的固定厕所时间（囚犯们当天最后一次上普通厕所的时间，而不是在牢房里用便桶如厕。）。夜班狱警们利用了这个时间，以各种方式折磨和玩弄了囚犯。这时，我也已经对囚犯们的痛苦熟视无睹。这样的虐待行为也变成了我每天日程上的常规项目，和计划中的厕所时间一同照常进行。


That is when I received an unexpected challenge from a visitor observing how the guards were dehumanizing and tormenting the prisoners. Christina Maslach, a new psych professor at U.C. Berkeley, whom I had begun dating, came down to take me out to dinner. However, when she saw the ongoing treatment of the hooded, chained prisoners, she ran outside in tears. We had a major confrontation in which she made clear that this situation had changed me from a teacher who loved students into someone who could be so indifferent to student suffering. She then said she did not want to continue our relationship if I did not come to my senses. That was my wake-up call to shed the Prison Superintendent garb and return to my usual persona, and then decide to terminate the SPE. 


也是在那时，我遇到了一个意想不到的挑战：一位参观者观察到了狱警们是怎样变得人性泯灭，并开始折磨囚犯的。那时，我正在与加州大学伯克利分校 ( U.C Berkeley )的心理学教授克里斯蒂娜•马斯拉奇( Christina Maslach )约会，她来约我出去吃晚餐。然而，当她看到那些戴着兜帽、绑着镣铐的囚犯的待遇时，突然泪流满面地跑了出去。我们大吵了一架。她明确表示，这个实验使我从一个热爱学生的老师，变成了一个对学生的痛苦漠不关心的人。她接着说，如果我不醒悟过来，她会和我分手。那件事为我敲响了警钟，使我脱离了监狱管理者的躯壳，回到了我原有的身份。随后，我决定终止 SPE 实验。


So what really happened in the five days of the SPE ? Was it an unfolding drama of human nature in its worst apparel, or just kids play-acting to please the director?
I choose to believe the former, although its critics would rather argue for the latter. 


那么，在 SPE 实验的五天里到底发生了什么? 这是一部展现人性丑陋的戏剧？还是孩子们仅仅为了取悦导演而做的角色扮演游戏?


我选择相信前者，尽管批评者们都更支持后者。


Enduring Legacies 


I believe that three of my contributions to psychology and society have emerged in various ways from extensions of ideas I extracted from the SPE. They are: understanding and treating shyness; understanding and utilizing the power of time perspective in improving the quality of our lives and in treating trauma; and finally, the creation of the Heroic Imagination Project to inspire compassionate social action for good and against evil.


****历久弥新的宝藏****


我认为我对心理学和对社会的三大贡献，都来自我从 SPE 实验中提取出来的思想延伸。它们是：了解和治疗害羞; 了解并利用时间观的力量，来改善生活品质和治疗创伤; 最后，创造「英雄想象工程」，以激发社会上由同情引发的助善惩恶行动。


Shyness. I first conceptualized shyness in 1972 as a self-imposed psychological prison in which the shy individual plays the dual roles of guard who limits his or her freedom of all speech and social behavior, and also the reluctant prisoner who submits to those constraints and thus loses much self-esteem. I went on to do the pioneering research on this topic, created the first shyness treatment clinic (still in operation at Palo Alto University), and also published several popular books and magazine articles for the general public. Thus, I have integrated education, research, therapy and public awareness of this widespread personal and social phenomenon.


****害羞。****


 1972 年，我第一次将害羞概念化：害羞实质上是一所自我压迫的心理监狱，在这个监狱里，害羞的人扮演了狱警和囚犯的双重角色。狱警限制着囚犯的言论自由和社交自由，而作为抗拒的囚犯，他们又屈从于这些限制，丧失了个人尊严。随后，我继续在这个话题上做了许多开创性研究，创建了第一家治疗羞怯的诊所（仍在帕洛阿尔托大学继续营业中），并公开出版了几本受欢迎的书籍和几篇杂志文章。因此，我对这种普遍存在的个人和社会现象，做过综合了解、调查、治疗和公众意识研究。


Time Perspective. My interest in exploring the psychology of time perspective, or the temporal zones in which we all live in, often without our awareness, in part emerged from the sense of distorted time we all experienced during the SPE. Without clocks or windows, that basement prison’s time revolved around each guard shift coming and going. We often felt trapped in an expanded present time zone when the guards were endlessly harassing the prisoners, or in a present fatalistic time zone that most prisoners experienced when nothing they did made a difference in how they were treated. I subsequently developed a scale to measure individual differences in time perspective, the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, ZTPI; conducted original research on the topic; published several books on time perspective and its applications in various kinds of therapy both to heal trauma and to improve the quality of our lives. In addition, I have started a worldwide movement of researchers and practitioners studying, using and extending the ideas and procedures that emerged in part from one of my many personal experiences during the SPE.


时间观。我对时间观心理学的研究兴趣，或者对于研究我们无意识生活的时区的兴趣，部分来源于我们在 SPE 实验中所经历的时间扭曲感。没有了时钟和窗户，地下室监狱里的时间流逝取决于狱警的轮岗交替。当狱警不停地骚扰囚犯时，囚犯们会感到被困在了一个漫长的时区内。而当囚犯们所做的事情对他们的待遇毫无影响时，囚犯们会感觉他们处在宿命的生命时区内。因此，我创立了一个量表，用来衡量时间洞察力的个体差异，叫做津巴多时间量表（ ZTPI ）; 我对该课题进行了原创研究; 我出版了几本关于时间透视和时间透视在治疗创伤和提高生活品质方面的应用书籍。此外，我还发起了一场全球范围内的运动，让全球的研究人员和实践者研究、使用和扩展那些我在SPE实验期间的个人经历中所产生的想法和程序。


Creating Everyday Heroes. In the final chapter of The Lucifer Effect, I switched focus entirely from trying to understand why and how good people can turn evil to asking whether it is possible for ordinary people to be inspired and trained to become everyday heroes. Since then, and with support of colleagues following my public statement of that theme in my 2007 TED talk, On the Psychology of Evil, I've devoted my academic and personal life to creating a nonprofit foundation, The Heroic Imagination Project, HIP. Its mission is to inspire and train ordinary people, especially our youth, to be ready and willing to enact extraordinary deeds of compassion in challenging situations they face in their lives. In addition to a research agenda, we have developed a unique educational program that provides the foundation for training people how to think and act heroically in situations they face. These lessons have demonstrated effectiveness with high school and college students, as well as in business settings. HIP has become a global movement with vibrant programs in more than a dozen nations on several continents, with many more coming on board soon.

创造生活中的英雄。在《路西法效应》( Lucifer Effect )的最后一章中，我将重点由试图理解为什么好人会变成坏人以及好人是如何变成坏人的，完全转移到了普通人是否可能受到鼓舞并接受训练，成为日常生活中的英雄。在那之后，在同事们的支持下，我在 2007 年的 TED 演讲中，就该主题发表了题为《邪恶心理学》的演讲。在学术研究和个人生活方面，我致力于创立非盈利基金会——「英雄想象工程」（ HIP ）。它的使命是激励和训练普通人，特别是年轻人，使他们在生活中面临挑战的情况下，随时做好准备，并展现他们美好的同情心。除了科学研究，我们还开发了一个独特的教育项目，培训人们在面临困难时勇敢地思考和做出行动。这些课程已经在高中生和大学生群体，以及商业环境中做过试验，都达到了一定效果。现在，HIP 已经成为了全球性的运动，在几个大洲的十几个国家内都有着活跃的实践项目，还有更多的项目即将加入。想了解更多信息，请访问 [www.HeroicImagination.org](http://www.HeroicImagination.org)


Conclusion


I hope that this reply to the critics of the legitimacy and enduring value of the SPE help make evident that they are substantially wrong in their biased conclusions. For whatever its flaws, I continue to believe that the Stanford Prison Experiment has earned its deserved place as a valuable contributor to psychology’s understanding of human behavior and its complex dynamics. Multiple forces shape human behavior; they are internal and external, genetic and dispositional, historical and contemporary, cultural and personal. The more we understand these dynamics, the better we can all be at promoting what is best in human nature. That in my current life mission.


****结论****


关于 SPE 实验的合法性的批判和长期价值的质疑，我希望我的这一回答，能够证明那些偏见性的结论是错误的。尽管该实验有许多缺陷，我仍然相信「斯坦福监狱实验」做出了许多有价值的贡献，帮助心理学研究了解人类行为及其背后的复杂动机。人类行为是由多种因素促成的，这些因素可能来自内在或外在，可能来自自身基因或外在因素，可能来自历史或当代，可能来自文化或个人。我们越是了解这些动机，越能更好地发扬人性中最美好的魅力。这是我现在的人生使命。
