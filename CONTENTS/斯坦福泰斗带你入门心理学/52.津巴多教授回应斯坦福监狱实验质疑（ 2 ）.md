## 52.津巴多教授回应斯坦福监狱实验质疑（ 2 ）
下面是津巴多教授回应的第二部分：


第三个问题，一名囚犯质疑精神崩溃是一种「假象」。


Doug Korea ，囚犯编号 8612 ，被 Blum 认为是我和我的工作人员因为过于天真，受不了他不受控制的狂叫而过早就释放他的一个例子。Korpi 现在辩解说，他其实并不是那么沮丧，他只是装得 「比疯子更歇斯底里」。歇斯底里的定义是一种表现出压倒性或无法控制的恐惧或情绪过度行为的心理障碍。而这正是我们在研究中释放他的充分理由。 Korpi 的故事在过去的四十七年中发生了很多变化：从「假装疯狂以期早日离开，这样他就可以为即将举行的研究生考试学习」; 到「早点走出去，以便他能够引导一场起义并解放其他囚犯」;再到「要真正地控制自己的情绪，所以进入临床心理学学习更好的情绪管理」;以及其他的反思和记忆的扭曲。


The key event in his scenario happened the night when he told his fellow prisoners that he was going to force me to release him after he met with both Carlo Prescott and me. Instead, after I offered him a deal in which the guards would no longer harass him if he would give me information about what the prisoners were doing, he returned to the prison yard and yelled: 「I can’t get out; they won’t let us leave!」He continued screaming that theme from inside his cell. This message had a powerful chilling effect on all the prisoners, some of whom later reported feeling helpless, truly imprisoned, and unable to quit even when as distressed as he was. Thus, Korpi contributed to the reality of the SPE as a 「real」 prison with no way out at all for all of his comrades, by that tirade. 


他叙述中的那晚的关键事件是在他与 Carlo Prescott 和我会面以后，他告诉其他囚犯他将迫使我释放他。 相反，在我向他提出了一项交换协议，即如果他告诉我囚犯们在做什么，狱警就不会再骚扰他，之后，他回到监狱院子里喊道：「我不能出去; 他们不会让我们离开！」然后他从他的牢房继续如此尖叫。 这一消息对所有囚犯都产生了强烈的寒蝉效应，其中一些人后来报告说，他们感到无助，真正被囚禁，即使像他那样痛苦也无法离开。 因此，Korpi的这个「长篇独角戏」，把 SPE 变成了一个「真正的」监狱，对于他的其他同监来说，再没有出路了。


Finally, the decision to release him after his screaming episode was made by Craig Haney, who determined he was so distressed that it did not make sense to retain him longer. When I returned from dinner with Carlo, I doubted the authenticity of Korpi’s reaction as honest, assumed he was faking it, but agreed with Craig and Curt Banks that it was a better course of action to release him at that point.


最后，在他的尖叫剧集之后释放他的决定是由 Craig Haney 做出的，他觉得 Korea 所承受的压力如此之大，没有理由让他囚禁更长时间了。 当我和 Carlo 晚餐回来时，我怀疑 Korea 的不是那么真诚，或说，他在伪装，但我同意 Craig 和 Curt Banks 的「释放他更好」的意见。


Regardless of what Korpi has said subsequently about his reaction, as acting or authentic hysteria, he created an obvious new route to freedom for at least four other prisoners who had to be released because of similarly extreme emotional reactions or to get necessary medical treatment, as detailed in The Lucifer Effect. All of them were first taken to Stanford Student Health, and then returned home.


不管 Korpi 事后如何解释自己的行为反应，不管是表演还是真的歇斯底里，他为至少四名「同囚」创造了一个明显的，新的获得自由的途径，他们也因为类似的极端情绪反应或必要的医疗治疗而获释；这些在「路西法效应」中有详述。 他们全部首先被带到斯坦福大学学生健康中心，然后回到家中。


A staff member publicly denounces SPE as flawed and dishonest. Blum attempts to smear the SPE by uncovering a 2005 Op-ed in the Stanford Daily Campus Newspaper, allegedly written by Carlo Prescott: 「The lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment.」He even borrows that title theme for his blog.


第四个问题，一名工作人员公开谴责 SPE 是有缺陷和不诚实的。 


Blum 试图通过找到一篇 2005 年发表于斯坦福日报（校园报）上的专栏文章来抹黑 SPE ，这篇报道据说是 Carlo Prescott 写的：「斯坦福监狱实验的谎言」。他甚至借用了他的博客的标题主题。


The reality is that Prescott never wrote a word of it. He and I had become friends after our first meeting in my social psychology class in May 1971 . He was my expert consultant on prison life, having been in prisons for years. A careful reading of that Op-ed piece makes evident that the writer had a very distinctive legalistic style and vocabulary, not at all like Carlo’s. It turns out that its real author, who also published many related negative SPE comments online, was Michael Lazarou, an L. A. movie writer. He had befriended both Carlo and me in an attempt to get me to agree to give him screen rights to a Hollywood movie about the SPE . When instead, I chose to go with Maverick Films producer, Brent Emery, Lazarou began writing negative critiques of both me and the SPE. (Brent Emery’s phone records indicated, 「Carlo said it was NOT him, but all from Lazarou.」 May 7, 2005 ). I assume this core information eliminates that source of Blum’s accusation of 「the lie of SPE」 as coming from a trustworthy insider.


事实上，这篇文章完全不是 Prescott 所写的。他与我在我 1971 年 5 月的一堂社会心理学课上第一次相见就变成朋友了。他是我关于监狱生活的专业顾问，因为他在监狱里待过许多年。仔细地阅读那篇专栏文章，会发现作者的行文与用词都具有一种特殊的法律性，与 Carlo 的完全不一样。其实，这篇文章以及许多网络上对于SPE的负面评论的真实作者，都是Michael Lazarou ，一个洛杉矶的电影编剧。他与我和 Carlo 是在一次尝试获得我准许去拍摄一部关于 SPE 的好莱坞电影时相识的。但在我选择了 Maverick Films 来制作这部电影后，Brent Emery 和 Lazarou 就开始对于我和 SPE 写负面评论。（ Brent Emery 的电话录音显示，「 Carlo 说那并不是他，全是来自于 Lazarou 的。」2005 年 5 月 7 日）。我认为这一重要的信息排除了 Blum 关于一个可靠的内部研究人员指责「 SPE 的谎言」的指控。


British research team fails to replicate SPE . An 「experiment,」supposedly based on the SPE , was filmed and broadcast on a 4-part BBC-TV show in May, 2002 ( Koppel & Mirsky 2002 ). Its results appeared to challenge those of the SPE because the guards showed little violence or cruelty toward the prisoners. Instead, the opposite occurred. The prisoners dominated the guards, to the point where the guards became 「increasingly paranoid, depressed and stressed and complained most of being bullied.」 Several of the guards couldn’t take it any more and quit: none of the prisoners did so. Blum points to that TV show as another challenge to the validity of the SPE . However, in no way did this 「reality-show」meet the scientific criteria for a replication. 


第五个问题，英国的研究团队没有成功地复制 SPE 。


一个说是基于 SPE 的「实验」被录制，并于 2002 年 5 月在 BBC 的电视上播出( Koppel & Mirsky 2002 )。它所得出的结果似乎反驳了 SPE ，因为其中的狱警表现出了极少对于囚犯的暴力与残忍行为。正好相反，囚犯们主导了狱警，而狱警则变得「越来越多疑，抑郁，感到压力，并抱怨说收到了虐待」。有几个狱警因为无法忍受而退出实验，但没有任何囚犯退出。Blum 表示这个电视节目是对于 SPE 效度的又一挑战。然而，这个「真人秀」在任何意义上都没有达到一个科学复制的标准。


From the time of being recruited with national ads to be actors in a 「university-backed social science experiment to be shown on TV,」every participant knew their actions and voices (from lapel mikes they had to wear always) would be seen and heard on national TV by family and colleagues. Any similarity to the intense build-up of emotional confrontations between SPE guards versus prisoners, 24/7 , was totally diluted by the daily itinerary of the British research team ( Alex Haslam and Stephen Reicher ). These researchers continually intervened, made regular public broadcasts into the prison facility, administered daily psychological assessments, arranged contests for the best prisoners to compete to become guards, and as in all 「reality-TV」 shows, created daily 「confessionals」 for participants to talk directly to the camera about their feelings.


从全国性广告中被征募，成为参与「一项在全国电视播放，由大学支持的社会科学实验」的演员时，每个参与者都知道他们的行为和声音 (--他们必须一直佩戴领口的话筒)会被家人和同事在国家电视台上看到和听到。SPE 中警卫与囚犯之间，那种七天二十四小时的紧张情绪与对抗完全被稀释了——英国研究小组( Alex Haslam 和 Stephen Reicher )的日常行程稀释了所有相似之处。这些研究人员不断地进行干预：定期在监狱设施进行公共广播；每日进行心理评估；安排比赛，以便让比赛中的最佳犯人成为保安。在整个「真人秀」节目中，他们为参与者们创造了日常「忏悔」环节，让参与者直接面对摄像机谈论他们的感受。


Among the participants in this BBC-TV prison show, who had contacted me personally afterwards, was Philip Bimpson, the ringleader of the prisoner rebellion against the hapless guards. He said, in part:「The prisoners won because they had organized themselves quicker than the guards; their subversive actions and organizational skills outwitted the guards who were disorganized in their new surroundings. They did not understand that they had to organize themselves and form a set of rules that they all agreed on. . . . I think the group is being exploited by the BBC for commercial gain. Me and my new friends in the group joined the experiment for the furtherance of science & not to be used as a form of cheap entertainment.」 (Personal email communication, 26 Feb. 2002 ; supplemented by my subsequent visit in Glasgow, Oct. 10 , 2004 )


在这档由英国广播公司( bbc )制作的监狱节目中，有一位参与者后来亲自联系了我，他就是菲利普•宾森( Philip Bimpson )。他说的部分内容如下:
「……犯人赢了，因为他们比卫兵组织得快。他们的颠覆行动和组织能力胜过了在新环境中毫无组织性的警卫。他们（也就是警卫）不明白，他们必须组织自己，形成一套他们都同意的规则。我认为，这个小组被 BBC 利用了，用来获取商业利益。我和我在小组里的新朋友们（应该）参加的是一个为了促进科学发展的实验，而不是一种廉价娱乐的形式。」(个人电子邮件通讯，2002 年 2 月 26 日;随后，我于 2004 年 10 月 10 日访问了格拉斯哥。


I think it is reasonable to reject the use of this 「replication」 as a scientifically sophisticated challenge to any of the conclusions of the SPE .


我认为，拒绝使用这种「复制」来得出对于 SPE 具有科学意义的复杂性的怀疑，是合理的。


Publication in non-peer reviewed journals to avoid rejection. Several critics claim that I chose to publish early accounts of the SPE in non-peer reviewed journals in order to avoid likely rejection of this study. That is not the case at all. We published our first account of the SPE in the Journal of the Office of Naval Research because I had used funds from ONR that were left over from a previous grant, and they insisted that I document my research in their journal. (Incidentally, the full budget for the SPE was only $2,500 ). Our next publication was in the Journal of Criminology, at the invitation of their editor.


第六个问题，发表在非同行评审的期刊，以避免被驳回。


有几位批评家声称，我选择在非同行评议期刊上发表 SPE 的早期报告，是为了避免这项研究被拒绝。事实并非如此。我们之所以在《海军研究办公室》杂志上发表了关于 SPE 的第一个报告，是因为我使用了海军研究局之前批准的一项基金，而他们坚持让我将我的研究刊载在他们的期刊上。(顺便一提，SPE 的全部预算只有 2500 美元)。我们的下一篇文章应编辑的邀请发表在《犯罪学杂志》上。


I am accused of 「sidestepping the usual peer review process」by then publishing an unusual account of the SPE in the New York Times Magazine in 1973 . I did so in response to an opportunity to reach a large national audience, and I used an unusual framing of the SPE as a Pirandellian Prison (to be described fully in a later section). My colleagues and I have published many articles and chapters about the SPE in a host of journals and books for academic audiences as well as more general readers (a selection of which appears in the References).


1973 年，我在《纽约时报》( New York Times )杂志上发表了一篇关于 SPE 的不同寻常的文章，被指责「绕开了通常的同行审查程序」。我这么做是为了广泛的接触全国（此处指美国）观众，我用了一种不同寻常的方式把 SPE 设计成了「皮兰德里监狱」(在后面的章节中会详细描述)。我和我的同事在众多期刊和书籍上，发表了许许多多关于 SPE 的文章，供学术读者和普通读者阅读(参考文献中有部分呈现)。
