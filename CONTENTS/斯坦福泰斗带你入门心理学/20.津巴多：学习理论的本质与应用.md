## 20.津巴多：学习理论的本质与应用
In this chapter , we will learn how we learn. 


Behavioral psychologists have discovered how humans respond to non-operant conditioning and operant conditioning , which results in relatively consistent changes in behavior . Can we change how we learn so that we become more efficient in how we act successfully to deal with our everyday world ?


My preparation for this chapter on the psychology of learning reminded me of my graduate school training at Yale University back in the 1950s , which at that time was the center of behavioral psychology . However, since that time , in the modern psychology of learning research and theories of learning have expanded enormously in many very interesting new directions . Practical aspects of learning are now also very applied in the sense of trying to understand how we can improve the way we learn efficiently so that we can retain and utilize the many lessons in our everyday lives .


在本章中，我们将学习如何去学习。 


行为心理学家已经发现人类是如何通过应对非操作性条件反射和操作性条件反射，使行为发生相对持续的变化。 我们能否改变我们的学习方式，使我们能够更有效地应对这个世界呢？


准备这一章内容的时候，我想起 50 年代我在耶鲁大学读研的经历。当时耶鲁可谓是行为心理学的中心。 然而，从那时起，现代心理学关于学习的研究和理论已经扩展到很多有趣的新方向。 从实操的角度讲，学习理论也被应用了，用来帮助我们理解怎么学习更有效，以便让我们在日常生活中能够保留和利用很多经验。
