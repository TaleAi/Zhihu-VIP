## 48.津巴多：智力研究——从单一到多元
I had mixed feelings in preparing to write this chapter on assessment, because on the one hand it is a unique achievement of psychology compared to all other social sciences, however on the other hand earlier psychologists were guilty of using inappropriate testing methods to allegedly prove the inferiority of certain cultural groups. Fortunately, new procedures are being used to establish the validity of IQ tests for individuals as well as cultural groups. I think many students will also appreciate recent ideas that intelligence is not only limited to cognitive function, but also there is much to learn about emotional intelligence.


在写智力测量这一章时，我心情很复杂。原因在于，一方面，与其他社会科学相比，这是属于心理学的独特成就。但是，另一方面，早期的心理学家也犯了不少错误，比如使用不适当的测试方法，声称证明了某些文化群体智力低下。 幸运的是，我们现在使用新的方式，来确定个人以及文化团体的智商测试是不是有效。 我认为，很多同学也会同意学界最新的观点：也就是说，智力不仅仅局限于认知功能，还需要更多地了解情商。
