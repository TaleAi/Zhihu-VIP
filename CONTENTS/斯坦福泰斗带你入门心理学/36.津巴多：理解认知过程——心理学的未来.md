## 36.津巴多：理解认知过程——心理学的未来
The cognitive revolution in psychology was a really interesting chapter for me to design. Because it integrates so many vital aspects of high mental functions such as language thinking and problem solving, memory perception and especially human intelligence.
I really enjoy the final section on the psychology of decision making in part because of my connection with my Stanford psychology former colleague Amos Tversky who did most of the pioneering research on heuristics and judgement using my students in introductory psychology as his subjects. His co-researcher Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel prize in economics for their research. Sadly, Amos had died earlier, so is not allowed to be a secondary awardee. 


对我来说，心理学的认知革命这一章，写起来非常有意思。 因为它集成了高级心理功能的重要方面，诸如语言、思维和问题解决、记忆、感知，特别是人类智能等等。我真的很喜欢决策心理学的最后部分，部分原因和我的斯坦福心理系前同事，埃姆斯.特沃斯基( Ames Tversky )有关，他进行了大量关于直觉和判断力的开创性研究，还用了不少我刚入门心理学的学生做实验。 他的合作研究者丹尼尔.卡尼曼( Daniel Kahneman )也因为这些研究获得了诺贝尔经济学奖。 不过令人伤感的是，埃姆斯去世太早，所以没有成为共同获奖者。
