## 16.津巴多：意识边界远超我们的想象
Chapter 5: 


In this chapter on mind, consciousness and altered states, we learn that we attend to stimuli selectively in the environment, and our mind develops a whole set of frameworks to make sense of what we observe of the world. We often see things that are not physically present and hear things when there are not acoustically measured. We actively organize and interpret information and build our own connection with the world,in our mind’s imagination.


When I was writing this chapter I realized that there is so much more to our personal psychology than we know simply from the physics of sensory input. Our minds create an inner reality, which may or may not correspond to external reality. As children, we create fantasy games and imaginary identities. As adults, we can consciously alter our perception in a number of ways such as meditation and also through hypnosis. I have been trained to use hypnosis as a form of guided imagery in therapy as well as in self-healing.I recommend experiencing such training by a competent, certified hypnotherapist.


在本章「心理，意识和其他状态」中，我们了解到人在环境中选择性地注意到刺激，人的思维发展出了一整套框架来理解观察到的世界。我们也能看到没有实际存在的东西，听到没有实际音节的声音。我们积极地组织和解读信息，同时会用想象力与世界建立联系。


当写这一章的时候，我意识到，我们的个人心理体会到的远比我们仅仅从感官得到的信息多得多。我们的头脑创造了一个内在的现实，这个现实可能与外在的现实一致或并不一致。作为孩子，我们创造幻想的游戏和虚拟的身份。作为成年人，我们可以有意识地通过冥想或者催眠改变知觉。我接受过催眠训练，引导想象用于治疗以及自我疗愈。我建议你体验一下由经过认证的催眠师组织的催眠。
