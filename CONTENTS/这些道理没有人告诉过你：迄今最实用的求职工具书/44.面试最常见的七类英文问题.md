## 44.面试最常见的七类英文问题
对外企的英文面试应该按照以下步骤来进行准备： 


1.预测问题。这个环节不但能帮助你克服听力困难，而且能缓解你在面试时的紧张情绪。 


2.口头甚至书面准备答案。英语 8 级的牛人也会在英文面试时出现逻辑不清的情况，因为流利和井井有条绝对不是同义词。当然，有同学担心写下来的答案会死板，那么，口头准备亦可！ 


3.全真模拟。背诵绝对不可！但是，找个高手给自己做做模拟，绝对能大大提高你的成功概率。 


衡量英文回答是否精彩，也只有一个标准：这个回答中，体现了申请人的什么特征，这个特征是否刚好适合所申请职位。 


**一、Personal information:关于个人信息的问题**


**1.What´s the meaning of your English name?（你的英文名字有什么含义吗？）**


问题分析：有些申请人的英文名字不合常规，比如叫 King，或者 Sushi，或者 Monk 等。面试官询问这些申请人名字的含义，主要有几个目的：第一，缓解面试的紧张气氛；第二，面试官也有一点点好奇心；第三，给申请人一个展示自己独特个性的机会，因为敢于给自己起独特名字的人往往具有独特的个性，这些人希望引起别人的注意。 


回答一：Actually， Sushi is my nickname， my friends gave me this name because I like to eat the Japanese food sushi. 


点评：这个回答体现出她是个什么样的人呢？爱吃寿司……虽然不会引起负面印象，但是也不会有正面印象。 


回答二：I love cooking.I often make sushi for my friends， so they often call me「Master Sushi」or just「Sushi」…… 


点评：这个回答体现出她是个什么样的人，动手能力比较强的、喜欢做一些细节的事情……完美匹配行政、人力、客服等岗位。 


**2.What´s the meaning of your E-mail address?（你的电子邮件地址有什么寓意吗？）**


问题分析：当代青年男女普遍个性张扬，所以连 E-mail 地址往往也颇为独特。令人或迷惑或大笑的 E-mail 地址有很多，比如 neverlazy， bighead， lazyfish，52n52n， yulovehong，等等。与上一个问题一样，善于交流的面试官往往乐于给你一个机会展示自己的个性。 


回答一：52n52n？Oh， it means I love you， I love you， because 5 sounds like「I」in Chinese， and 2 for「love」，「n」for「you」.I registered this address to please my girlfriend. 


点评：公开示爱？除了他的女朋友会觉得甜蜜蜜，别的人一律会反胃。 


回答二：Never lazy？Oh， I signed up this address in sophomore year to encourage myself never to be lazy， because at that time， I realized we seemed to be spending more time watching movies and dating……haha. 


点评：第一，她轻描淡写地说到自己在大二就注册了这个 E-mail，打消了面试官觉得她临时注册这个邮箱博人眼球的那一丝疑惑。此外，在 E-mail 地址中都要给自己励志的女子，一定是个工作狂人。（这名女生如愿进入了宝洁。） 


**3.Where are you from?？Where is your hometown?（你是哪里人？家乡在什么地方？）**


问题分析：很多老外在中国工作居住多年，甚至自诩中国通，他们可能会顺便问问你是哪里人，拉近和你的距离。 


回答一：I was born and raised in the city of Wuhan.Actually， my home is not far from our Wuhan Office on Hantang Street…… 


点评：这个回答说出了该公司在武汉的地址，展示了一下自己提前所做的功课。 


回答二：Come from a very small town in the Northeast of China， it´s still far underdeveloped， you know， nothing like big cities like Beijing.The local people can only earn less than one thousand Yuan RMB per year. 


点评：比较健谈，也比较煽情：家乡人均 1000 元的收入会让面试官有些唏嘘，在潜意识里会希望帮助你。 


4.What are some of your hobbies?（你有哪些爱好？） 


问题分析：由爱好判断性格，老外也爱这么干。 


回答：I used to play chess a lot with my friends， but right now my only hobby seems watching TV to relax my mind.I´ve been too busy with my work to「afford」any time for my hobby. 


点评：喜欢下棋，但是工作太忙，所以就只能看看电视放松一下——这样的忙碌形象是符合多数老板期望的！ 


**二、Education:关于教育背景的问题**


5.Why did you select your major area of study?（你为什么选择这个专业？） 


问题分析：外国面试官更喜欢提「为什么」的问题，他们希望申请人是一个有主见的人。 


回答一：I was quite good at mathematics and physics back in high school， so I chose a related major， Telecommunications.I also applied for the major o.computer science， you know， these two majors are the hottest these years. 


点评：擅长数学，自然地沟通。 


回答二：As a matter of fact， I didn´t select the major of「Geography Education」at all as I have never 


wanted to be a teacher. I had chosen「Business Administration」，「Economics」and「Logistics Management」when I applied to study at Zhongshan University, but unfortunately I failed to get into these hottest majors as the score I got in College Entrance Examinations was about ten points less than the minimum requirement.The school「allocated」me to a cold major, Geography Education.Luckily, I could select a second major.I chose「Public Relations Management」to be my minor area of study.What was that saying?「If God closes the door, he will open a window for you.」 


点评：这个回答似乎很长，但是不得不这么长。这里面有一个典型的中国特色，如果你的分数够不上第一志愿，学校就把你打入某一个「冷宫」专业去，而你为了进入这所一流的大学不得不屈服。这种怪现象制造出很多感觉自己比窦娥还冤的「冤男怨女」，学着「地理教育」却痛恨从事教师职业，学着「国际政治」却连国际新闻都懒得看！这个回答的优点在于：第一，向外国面试官普及了一下中国特色；第二，强调了自己对商业和管理一贯的热诚；第三，告诉对方其实自己高考只差 10 分才没进最热门的专业；第四，自己是个不轻言放弃的人，主修学不成用辅修来弥补；第五，把上帝拉进来，也显得你很幽默。 


**6.What subjects were your favorite ones?Why?（你最喜欢的课程是什么？为什么？）**


问题分析：与中国面试官一样，对于应届毕业生，外国面试官经常问有关学业方面的问题。面试官喜欢的申请人，是对自己专业的优缺点能够分析得头头是道的人。 


回答：I like the subjects that include lots of experiments， for example，「CAD」and「Circuit Design」.I found that I can learn more quickly by doing experiments than studying the theories only.I guess it´s partly because I am good with hands， and doing experiments give me a chance to learn in a creative way. 


点评：利用课程说到自己「善于动手」和「有创造力」的优点，不错。 


**7.What subjects were your least favorite ones?Why?（你最不喜欢的课程是什么？为什么？）**


问题分析：外国面试官往往更加辩证，在问完成功经历后一定要追问失败经历，问完喜欢什么科目之后也要问问不喜欢什么科目。 


回答一：My least favorite courses include「Marxism」and「Revolutionary History of China」.I don´t like these subjects not because I am not a patriot， actually I love my country and I am fascinated by the revolutionary history of it.However， these subjects turned out to be disappointments as the textbooks and the ways they were taught were nothing but a repetition of the history subjects in our secondary school. 


点评：在回答老外面试问题的时候，要注意文化差异，他可能很难理解中国学生为什么不喜欢学《马哲》和《中国革命史》，所以你需要解释一下，这并非我们不爱国，而是这两门课程几十年如一日的老面孔，学生在高中就已经学过，老师也不愿意对教学法进行创新。 


回答二：I found「Macroeconomics」and「Microeconomics」disappointing as well， for the same reason that the information fell behind the times， for example， the exchange rate between RMB and USD stilled remained 8.3:1 till now！You can imagine how disappointing we were.So I spent more time listening to the lectures on economics organized by the Student Union. 


点评：这个答案更好，因为它表露出的信息是，我热爱学习宏观与微观经济学，我学习兴趣很浓厚，但是很遗憾，这两门课没有满足我对知识的渴望。这就是典型的「表面看是负面信息，实则体现了正面信息」。 


8.Other than the courses you studied, what is the most important thing you learned from your college experience?（除了学习方面，你在大学里面最大的收获是什么？） 


问题分析：外国面试官的思维往往非常直接，他们往往坚持认为，只有在大学里面有巨大收获的人，才能在工作岗位上取得巨大收获。所以，千万不要天真地说：我在大学里学会了自理，学会了安排自己的生活！晕，这是童年的成就，绝对不能拿到大学里面来说了。 


回答一：Well， I think the most important thing I have learnt in university is that I´ve learnt how to set appropriate goals and see them through.You know it is so easy for university students to waste time if we don´t set goals， so I set demanding goals to motivate myself.One is that I decided to get scholarships each year， the other one is that I decided to be the leader of a club on campus.Neither was easy， but in more than three years， I managed to achieve both. 


点评：这是一个很漂亮的回答，体现了自己的优点，既能够给自己设立比较高的目标，也擅长克服困难实现自己的目标。面试官最喜欢的，就是这种「目标导向型」的申请人。 


回答二：I believe the best I have achieved in university is that I´ve improved my general ability， for example， presentation skill， question exploring， pressure handling and so on.Take the monitor election activity as an example.I have to develop the skill to present myself in front of 70-80 students.Through different activities， I have made progress in leading.communication， organizing.This probably is the best I have achieved. 


点评：这个回答符合我们一贯强调的「个性化」和「夸赞自己」两个原则。 


**三、Experience:关于工作经验的问题**


**9.Would you briefly describe thi.company to me?（介绍一下你的原单位，好吗？）**


问题分析：当老外提出这个问题的时候，他心里的疑问是——「这个公司我从来没有听说过，是不是一个小烂公司」。如果真的是小公司，你务必强调出个体的能力。 


回答：「Guang Fa」，the name means「a big, prosperou.company」，although it´s not really a very bi.company.But， it´s true that th.company is quite prosperous.It specializes in lady shoes exports.With only 10 employees so far the turnover last year was up to 15,000,000 Yuan RMB.I am one of the three customer service officers， with the responsibility of order taking， tracking and general customer service roles.Due to the limited number of staff， we all overwork with more than 10 hours a day，7 days a week in busy season. 


点评：很明显，这个回答既体现了自己原来的公司的规模，也暗示了自己能够适应繁忙的工作的特点。 


**10.Would you describe a typical working day of yours?（请你描述一下自己典型的一天的工作吧。）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官希望捕捉的信息点是，第一，这个家伙原来干的工作和我们现在这份工作到底有多少是类似的？第二，他原来的工作表现到底怎样？ 


回答：Yes.I would arrive at office half an hour earlier as my boss often gives me a lot of work once h.comes in， and I have to be ready for it.My responsibilities are mainly to assist the sales manager and representatives， e.g.order tracking， stock report， document preparation and translation， using Excel， Word and PPT.When the reps are on business trip， I will deal with their share.Two thirds of my work i.computer involved， working on table and forms precisely and quickly， the rest of time is to take care of the managers and reps， you know， do what they need me to. 


点评：用事实说明自己是个敬业的人。在描述工作内容的时候，有细节性描述，也有总结性描述，非常清晰。 


**11.Why do you want to leave your job?（你为什么要离职？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官希望捕捉的信息点是，第一，这个家伙到底有没有说实话？第二，他离职的原因是否代表了他的某个缺点。比如，因为公司离家远就离职，说明他是个不能吃苦的人；在一两年之内没有升职就想跳槽的人太过好高骛远等。第三，他是否会因为同一个原因而在本公司再次跳槽？（具体参考中文面试回答） 


**12.Describe the employee you most enjoy working with?（你最喜欢和什么样的同事一起共事？）**


**问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官希望了解的是，第一，这份工作是否会令你开心；第二，你所欣赏的人往往就是你的影子（心理学家如是说），比如，如果你说自己欣赏爽直的人，往往你就是这样一个人！**


**回答一：I enjoy working with straightforward people， partly because I am a straightforward person myself.I hope my colleagues will offer their honest suggestions and even criticisms to me.Frankly speaking， I am not ver.comfortable with those people who are too sensitive and always hesitate to express themselves.**


**点评：突出了自己直爽的性格，很好。**


**回答二：I enjoy working with positive-minded people who don´t complain too much.I find it uncomfortable to work with those who alway.complain.In my opinion， we either need to make improvements or accept the facts.Complaining is a total waste of time.**


**点评：这是一个令人喜欢的回答，因为任何一个公司里都有大量的「怨男怨女」，令人反感却无可奈何。如果能多招聘几个「阳光男女」进公司，岂不美哉。**


回答三：I enjoy working with those who are action makers.I don´t like to work with big talkers or those who are very slow to react.I am a quick person myself， so I prefer to work with the people of the same kind. 


点评：大家都喜欢风风火火的人，只要不忙中出错就好！ 


回答四：Well， I like to work with those who are good at planning as they can always make a strong team with me.I am a detail person， and I need to work with big picture planners to achieve best results. 


点评：善于利用别人的长处弥补自己的不足，不错！ 


**13.What is an ideal boss like?（你最喜欢的老板是什么样子的？）**


问题分析：和上个问题一样，面试官希望了解的是，第一，这份工作是否会让你满意？第二，你一定会效仿你的老板，如果你说自己喜欢的老板是能吃苦耐劳的，那么你往往是一个吃苦耐劳的人；如果你说喜欢自己的老板是高屋建瓴的，那么你往往也是一个颇为注重宏观规划的人。要格外注意的是，如果面试你的人恰恰就是你未来的老板，那么这个问题可要小心了，如果你的描述和他的个性风马牛不相及，可能令面试功亏一篑。 


回答一：I like democratic bosses.He or she can give me enough room to develop myself， rather than giving instructions to me on every small detail. 


点评：这个回答比较危险，明显地表现出该申请人追求「自由化」的性格特点，会令很多面试官觉得心里一沉。所以说，在回答这个问题的时候，要走「保守主义」路线，尽量不要给人一种「初生牛犊不怕虎」的感觉，而要表现出谦虚谨慎、积极、诚恳等特点。再者说，这个回答明显在跟老板提要求，当你对比下面这个回答二的时候，你就会明白一个道理：给老板提要求，远远不如请老板给自己提要求令人喜欢！ 


回答二：Ideal boss？Well， I prefer strict bosses.Although working with strict bosses means a lot of pressure， I can grow fast with them.For a new graduate， nothing is more important than developing our abilities as fast as we can. 


点评：主动请老板为自己加压，多么可爱可敬的人，善哉。工作经验有所欠缺的申请人，不妨向面试官表表这样的态度！ 


回答三：Ideal boss？Let me see.Well， in my opinion， an ideal boss can effectively motivate his or her subordinates by encouraging good performances and punishing poor performances.I will feel highly motivated to do a good job if I know my boss would reward me if my performance is excellent. 


点评：好！一个希望老板能「奖惩分明」的员工，往往是很自信、能够有优良表现的员工。 


**14.What were the best aspects of your last job?（在上一份工作中，你最喜欢的是什么地方？）**


**问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点是，第一，这个申请人是个什么样的人？如果你是一个小秘书却喜欢有挑战，那么你很可能还停留在好高骛远的不成熟阶段；如果你喜欢原来的老板给你很大的自由发展空间，那么你很可能是个「自由派」，不太喜欢约束等。第二，你所申请的工作到底是否会让你满意？如果这份工作内容和你最喜欢的工作内容大相径庭，比如，你喜欢有挑战而偏偏这份工作很重细节，那么面试官可能会因为「自惭形秽」而拒绝你的申请。**


**回答一：The best aspect of my last job？Let me see.Well， I think it´s the trust of my boss.He gives me lots of room to develop myself， you know， letting me shoulder responsibilities.And I didn´t let him down.I did a good job.**


点评：一个令前任老板信任的员工，更有可能赢得未来老板的信任。 


回答二：The best aspect of my job， well， is that I can learn a lot from others.As you can imagine Carrefour has a team of high quality staff.When working with these people I can learn a lot， you know， their attitude to see things， the way they work. 


点评：乐于向别人学习的人，我们喜欢！I´m loving it！ 


回答三：The best aspect of my job？I think it´s the team I work with.As a sales assistant I work with the sales reps on a daily basis.It´s so interesting to work with them， as you can imagine the sales reps are all active and humorous guys.Besides， I can learn so much from them.After working with them for a year and a half， I feel I have「inherited」their good traits.I´m tougher， more positive and a lot better at pleasing others. 


点评：很多人都会说自己工作最好的地方是拥有一群好同事，但是只有在你给出细节之后才能打动面试官。这个答案很棒，既夸了自己的团队，也夸奖了自己。 


回答四：The best aspect of my job？I think it´s the fast pace of it.I was kept busy by my clients.You know I had two jobs， an.compared to the first job， which was dead quiet， I like the last busy job so much better.It makes me feel much more satisfied with myself. 


点评：用事实说明自己是喜欢繁忙工作的人，挺好。 


**15.What were the worst aspects of your last job?（在上一份工作中，你最讨厌的是什么地方？）**


问题分析：这是一个比较棘手的个问题，说得虚伪了没有人相信，说得太真实又唯恐令面试官反感。 


回答一：The worst aspect of my last job is definitely lack of job security.My pay was delayed twice in the four months I work here.I joined thi.company in hope of helping the boss to grow a small business into a bigger one.However， it proved a lot more difficult than I expected.The boss is very reluctant to invest in promotion.As a result， business has been rather slow. 


点评：职位不稳定，薪水不能保证，这的确是份糟糕的工作。不过，别忘记告诉面试官，这的确不是你的错。 


回答二：I have to work six days a week in my last job.You know it´s against the Labor Law but it´s the normal practice in many factories in Dongguan.It would be quite all right for me to work on Saturday occasionally， but certainly not every Saturday. 


点评：真诚沟通，很好。 


回答三：The worst part of my last job is that it´s too quiet.As it´s a branch liaison office it has only five people.And I don´t have enough workload.Sometimes I have little to do in the whole week！I really feel bored of working here.I´d like to have a busier job.You know， more responsibilities， more sense of achievement. 


点评：因为工作太清闲而辞职，这样的人谁不爱？ 


**16.What were some of your achievements in your last job?（在上一份工作中，你有哪些成就？）**


问题分析：一个颠扑不破的面试哲学是，在上一份工作中有成就的，才有可能在新工作中有成就。在回答这个问题的时候，一般要遵守一个原则——用事实与数字说话。 


回答一：I was named「Employee of the Year」，for the highest level of accuracy of all 18 bank tellers last year. 


点评：一个言简意赅而又强大的回答。既说出了所得到的奖励，而且列出了获奖原因，同时又告诉面试官自己在 18 人中是最佳的。 


回答二：I increased sales approximately 100%in three years.Last year I personally sold 1.5 million Yuan worth of services and was ranked No.2 in entir.company of 14 sales reps. 


点评：如果是做销售的同志，只能用数字来说明自己的业绩。 


回答三：I suggested to my boss that we should create a new type of customer satisfaction survey.This suggestion was applied later and effectively reduced custome.complaints. 


点评：对于没有得到过什么奖励的申请人，一个比较好的办法就是告诉面试官，自己的一个好建议被老板采纳，取得了非常不错的效果。 


**17.What were some of the disappointments in your last job?（在上一份工作中，你比较失望或者失败的地方是什么？）**


问题分析：这个问题相当棘手，太真实可能会吓坏面试官，太虚伪又没法令人相信。比较好的应对方式是，给对方列举一些非致命的失败，同时，这些失败的原因是自己所定的目标比较高。 


回答一：Disappointments？There were some.I couldn´t get an A in the annual evaluation， instead， I got B， which was not bad but certainly not good enough.And， I am not 100%satisfied with the accuracy of my work.I can work very efficiently， but I sometimes make mistakes， say， the typing mistakes， the error of dates in the reports I have done， etc. 


点评：这个回答很圆滑，因为他所有的失败都是在基于高标准严要求之下的吹毛求疵的失败。整个答案给我们的感觉不是在说失败，而是在暗示面试官：我是个对自己有很高要求的人，所以我自然会有一些比较失望的地方。 


回答二：I failed to achieve the sales target last year， I sold a million and a half but the target was two million.This year， I´ve done 70%of the target， but I´m afraid I still can´t meet the target as our Beijing headquarter is having some problems and can´t provide effective pre-sales support for us.Failing to reach the target is a big disappointment for me. 


点评：一个很好的回答，体现出了一个销售人员对完成任务的强烈渴望。 


**18.How would you evaluate the progress you made in your last job?（你如何来评价自己在上一份工作中的表现？）**


问题分析：对于在上份工作中表现平平的申请人，这个问题简直如芒在背。所以，我们必须面壁三天掘地三尺想出工作中的亮点…… 


回答一：I am very proud of the progress I made in my last job.I joined th.company as a new hand， but after only a year and half， I was promoted to be a team leader.I could achieve such a rapid progress partly because my last job is in a small firm.If I can make the same progress in a larg.company like GE， I would be prouder. 


点评：回答得非常好，既体现了自己的迅速成长，也谦虚低调地指出自己是个羊群里的骆驼，在小公司里才能获得如此快速的提升。 


回答二：Well， I would give myself 70 if 100 is full satisfaction.I had some achievements in my last job.For example， I got B in annual evaluation last year， which was top 40%.The promotion program I organized on Beijing Road was highly successful and my client was very pleased.However， the results of several other programs were not quite satisfactory due to some reasons I couldn´t control.Actually that´s why I want to quit. 


点评：这个回答可能更符合多数申请人的实际情况，有成就，也有失败。 


**19.What pressures did you have in your last job and how you managed the work related pressures?（你工作中有什么压力，你是怎样应对的？）**


问题分析：平庸的人往往感受不到压力，有能力的人往往在工作中遭遇很大的压力，同时，他们处理压力的方法也是相当积极有效的。 


回答一：In my last job， most pressur.comes from the high sales target.It´s extremely difficult to meet the target as it´s 30%increase over the sales of last year， and the sales of last year was already quite high.However， I can manage this pressure well because， although I can´t meet the sales target， my sales abilities have never been challenged by my boss and others.Six out of seven sales reps can´t meet the target this year and I am actually quite close to the target. 


点评：虽然该申请人没有说出具体的应对压力的办法，但是他告诉面试官他并不受压力所困，因为自己的能力早已经被公认。这是一个很自信的回答。 


回答二：Well， I have to meet deadlines in my last job.Some projects have a very tight schedule， and even if we do a lot of over time work it´s still hard to meet the deadline.This gives me a lot of pressure.Usually I manage the pressure b.communicating honestly with my boss.If he can understand me I would feel relaxed. 


点评：非常入情入理的回答。做技术工作的人员通常为了赶项目而熬通宵，而如果熬通宵也不能如期交付项目的话，势必会造成心理压力。争取老板的理解，的确是缓解压力的好办法。 


回答三：There are quite many emergencies in my last job， you know， customer challenges， unexpected orders.As the customer service office of the longest experience I am usually put in charge of handling emergencies， you know， like firefighters.This gives me lots of pressure for I can´t let my boss down.I could handle these pressures well， partly because I´m used to them. 


点评：这是个超级棒的回答，它变相地告诉面试官，自己是最资深的客户服务代表，因此总是被派作「消防队队员」，自然要面临很大的压力。而自信，是应对压力的最好办法。 


**20.Sometimes a work assignment requires frequent travel.How do you react to the prospect of frequent travel?（有时候工作需要你经常出差，你怎么看？）**


问题分析：如果你兴高采烈地说：「哦，出差是免费旅游的好机会啊！」面试官只能哑然失笑或者苦笑，因为你太天真了，对于绝大多数人来说，出差绝对不是「美差」，而是「苦差」。所以，在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点有两个，第一，这个家伙成熟了没有？他对于这个职位本身的缺陷有没有心理上的准备？第二，这个家伙到底会采用什么样的方法，以避免出差损害自己的身体健康？所以说，面试官不想听大话和空话，他要听的是一些实实在在的小措施，能够让你常出差而不会觉得太辛苦。 


回答一：I traveled a lot in my last job.I traveled almost every week.As far as I know， this job requires me to travel， but not every week.So it won´t be worse than my last one. 


点评：以事实来回答质疑，永远是最上策。 


回答二：I am very lucky as I can eat and sleep very well on trips.I´ve never been carsick， and even when sitting on a train I can have a good sleep.So， I never need to worry about frequent traveling. 


点评：这是个很踏实很中肯的回答。有很多女性在出差的时候神经衰弱，精神不振，老板当然希望你能够在出差时吃好睡好、龙马精神。 


回答三：I don´t worry about frequent travel as my daughter is taken care by my parents， who are both well-educated scholars.It is not a big deal for them to educate a two-year-old little thing. 


点评：有家庭、有小孩的申请人要主动告诉面试官自己是如何处理家庭和工作的关系的。这是一个很博人好感的回答，有当教授的老爸老妈来带自己 2 岁的小家伙，还有什么后顾之忧呢？ 


**21.Most employees and bosses have some disagreements.How did you react to these disagreements in your last job?（很多雇员都和老板有意见相左的时候，在上一份工作中，你是如何处理和老板意见不同的情况的？）**


问题分析：这个问题通常会提给有几年工作经验的申请人。在这个问题上，面试官希望捕捉的信息点是，第一，这个家伙是一个有主见的人，还是一个唯老板之命是从的人？第二，这个家伙是更信任自己的老板，还是更信任自己？第三，在真正意见相左的时候，这个家伙是否能够高效地解决问题？ 


回答一：My boss in the last job is very democratic.He always listened to our opinions and gave us enough opportunities to defend our opinions.So we never had any troubl.communicating with each other when having disagreements. 


点评：这个回答体现了对老板的赞赏。把功劳归于老板，是很令人欣赏的一种素质。 


回答二：When I have disagreements with my boss， the first reaction is to double check my opinions， as my boss in the last job is an expert and he´s been proved right most of the times.If I do believe I´m right or partially right， I would provide my boss with a detailed report listing all facts and numbers to prove my opinion.As my boss is extremely busy， I need to make the report simple but powerful， to help him make the decision. 


点评：这个回答体现出了该申请人的两个优点，第一，在意见不合的情况下，他首先会信任自己的老板，检视自己的意见。第二，他会以事实和详细的数据来支持自己的观点，帮助工作繁忙的老板做出决策。善哉。 


**四、Position an.company:关于所申请职位和公司的问题**


**22.Why did you select thi.company?（你为什么要选择这家公司？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官希望捕捉的信息点是，第一，申请人是会诚实地说出自己选择该公司的理由，还是会从网络上找一大堆废话来搪塞面试官。第二，你了解这家公司吗？一个了解该公司的申请人能够准确地说出该公司的魅力。第三，你了解自己吗？一个有想法的申请人会有一堆理由来支持自己的决定，而绝不仅仅是因为一个公司的名气大而想加入。 


回答一：Mars（玛氏）is the dream employer for almost every single fresh graduate， not only because the starting salary is high， but also because you´ve designed an attractive career path for us.For me， another personal reason is I´ve been a loyal customer of Whiskas（伟嘉猫粮）for ten years！My two cats love Whiskas…… 


点评：这个回答体现了该申请人的两个特点，第一，他很诚实地告诉面试官，应届毕业生当然对玛氏趋之若鹜；第二，他因为爱猫而爱伟嘉猫粮，再因爱伟嘉猫粮而爱玛氏，夸奖了玛氏，也表达了自己的向往。 


回答二：To be honest， it would be ideal for me， a fresh graduate who specializes in Accounting， to join any of the big 4s because each of the big 4s has its own advantages.However， I´m particularly interested in KPMG for a very sentimental reason.I wa.completely fascinated by your career talk！Compared with yours， the other thre.companies are a bit boring. 


点评：这个回答体现了该申请人的两个特点，第一，实话实说，学会计的同学能进「四大」中的任何一个，的确都是求之不得的美事；第二，善于巧妙地「拍马屁」，告诉对方自己被他们的 Career talk 打动了，所以对该事务所情有独钟，的确是一个不错的回答。 


回答三：Shengjia is a professional ERP software provider， and I´ve been interested in ERP for a very long time.I believe ERP has a large market in China， even if this business may have some difficulties in the course of development. 


点评：如果你要进入的是一个不太知名的公司，那么你可以告诉面试官自己选择这家公司是因为自己对它所从事的业务有信心、有兴趣。 


**23.Why did you decide to apply for this particular position?（你为什么要申请这个职位？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官希望捕捉的信息点是，第一，你了解这个职位吗？一个了解该公司的申请人能够准确地说出该职位的优缺点和长远发展；第二，你了解自己吗？你的兴趣和特长是否吻合这个职位？ 


回答一：For the past three years I´ve been doing a similar job.Though my current boss has given me a raise twice I´m still not quite pleased with my salary， I believe you can understand，1800 Yuan is not a very good pay.Now that I have this opportunity to get a higher pay， to work in a more famou.company， of course I would give it a try. 


点评：这个回答有几个优点，第一，很真实，为钱而跳槽，是大多数人换工作的理由；第二，强调了自己已经在过去单位工作 3 年的经历，足够忠诚了；第三，强调了自己两次涨薪的事实，说明自己一定有过优异的表现。 


回答二：My career choice actually has been influenced a lot by my mother.She´s been a Admin&HR director in a large state-owne.company for over twenty years.She impressed on me（注释：反复强调）that HR jobs are suitable for women as it´s not influenced much by age， and females enjoy an equal opportunity of being promoted.However， the other top positions like sales often go to men.Besides family influence， I select this job also becauseI feel I am suitable to it.I´m easy-going， trusted by others. 


点评：这是一个很好的回答，真实，又夸奖了自己。告诉对方自己的家庭很支持自己从事这个职业，的确有加分的作用。 


回答三：I want to be a Sales Rep as it suits my expectations.First of all， I wish to get a pay based on my performance， you know， better results， better pay.Secondly， I hope I will be going out， meeting people instead of sitting in office.What´s more， sales.compared to other jobs can improve my abilities most quickly.I can learn how to observe others， how to persist， how to deal with coldness and rejection， and all these traits will help me to be successful in both career and personal life. 


点评：非常好地概括了销售工作的优点，体现了一个应届毕业生的活力和激情。 


**24.How do you see yourself being qualified for this position?（你觉得自己有多适合这个职位？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点是，第一，你了解这个职位的具体要求吗？第二，你是否能用事实逐一证明自己是最适合的人选？ 


回答一：I think I´m qualified because the job duties of this position are 80%same as my last job.And the rest 20%shouldn´t be a big problem because I´m quick to learn， and eager to learn.My ability to learn has been proved in my last job as well. 


点评：「我做过类似的工作」，永远是最能说服面试官的撒手锏。 


回答二：I studied your job ad and feel that I´m a good match.First， my writing ability is proved by the reports I´ve written， here they are.Second， m.computer skills are top in my class.I can show you now if you want me to.The only weakness seems to be lack of experiences.But， as you can see on my resume， I did have lots of part time experiences at the Tourism Club（注释：旅游协会）and Tianhe Volunteers Association（注释：天河区义工协会）.What I did there was to support the bosses， you know， writing reports， preparing files and so on.I worked for over two years in these associations， but most girls in my school only did it for a couple of months.I am a detail person with good patience and excellent service attitude.I hope you have found out these traits. 


点评：这是一个典型的标准答案。首先要把自己符合招聘启事的地方强调一下，其次要把不足之处弥补一下。关键得分点在于，你使用的是「过去时」，要用过去的经历来说明问题，而不是告诉面试官未来我会怎样的这种「将来时」。 


**25.What about this position is especially attractive to you?（这个职位最吸引你的地方是什么？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点是，第一，你是否对该职位有充分的了解？第二，什么因素最能激励你？是钱，还是职业发展机会？ 


回答一：I would be doing similar things as in my last job but with a higher salary in a more famou.company.That´s the main attraction of this position to me. 


点评：干同样的活儿而拿更多的钱，实话实说，适合很多实干型岗位，比如网管、客服等等。 


回答二：The best of this job， I think， is that it gives me an opportunity to become a professional in the shortest time.I can master the expertise of auditing with th.comprehensive trainings.Learning a professional skill is particularly important to me as my major of Business English is a tool instead of a career. 


点评：大公司通常为自己完善的培训体系而自豪，而应届毕业生也恰恰最需要这样的培训，所以说，这是个典型的「一拍即合」的回答，唯一的缺点就是它可能过于大众化。这个申请人做得就很好，他把自己的大学专业结合在答案中。他告诉面试官，自己所学的英语专业不能算是一种职业，只能是为某个职业而服务的工具，所以一份专业性强的工作对他来说格外有吸引力。 


**26.What do you see in the position that is not attractive to you?（这个职位最不吸引你的地方是什么？）**


问题分析：这个提问的考察目的是，你真的了解这个职位吗？了解职位缺点、能接受缺点的人，才是适合这个职位的人。 


回答一：I know the obvious disadvantage of this job for most people in this industry is the long hours of work to meet the deadline.My friend told me she ever sat in front o.computer for 36 hours without eating proper meals and sleep……but， I am sure I can deal with it.My mind always seemed quicker at night. 


点评：广告公司熬夜出方案是业内常态，没有人会喜欢连续工作 36 小时，但是，这就是工作性质。该候选人既表明了自己对该行业的了解，也用「过去时」表明自己能应付，比较可信。 


回答二：Our clients tend to trust senior， older sales engineers rather than fresh graduates.I have to try my best to look a bit「older」and talk in a more「mature」way. 


点评：很实在！ 


**27.Tell me what you know about ou.company.（说说你对我们公司的了解吧。）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点是，第一，这个家伙对我们公司到底有多么热诚？一个很迫切的申请人，会通过各种途径搜索该公司的信息。第二，这个家伙是否有什么独到的见解，他是否能说出别的申请人说不出来的信息？ 


回答：I´ve been following the twitter of three employees of ou.company for half a year， actually.From their description and pictures， I´ve got quite a lot of information about ou.company， for instance…… 


点评：从长期微博跟踪就能看出，这个候选人对这个职位是非常严肃认真的，同时也知道如何通过最佳渠道去了解一个职位。 


**五、Self Evaluation:关于自我评价的问题**


**28.How does your mother describe you?（你的母亲认为你是个怎样的人？）**


问题分析：只有外国面试官会这样提问，因为他不了解中国的国情。在中国，有两类母亲，一类是传统型的中国妇女，从来不会夸奖自己的孩子；另一类是高学历的现代母亲，因为只有一个孩子而看不到孩子的任何缺点。在面试中，你不妨把中国的这种「文化」传递给面试官，以使面试气氛更加轻松有趣。 


回答一：Well， it´s an interesting question.It reminds me of a Chinese saying， the best child is your own child， and the best wife is others´wife.It means a man or woman is always satisfied with the child， but not with the spouse.My mother is just like this.She tells everybody that I am hard-working， more hard-working than I should be.She says I am trustable and independent， never giving her troubles， you know， she sent me to boarding school at 14. 


点评：这个回答很好，它有两个优点，第一，比较有趣，轻松地传播了一点中国文化；第二，以事实说明了自己的刻苦与自立的特征。 


回答二：Most Chinese parents are not quite expressive as western parents.My mother has never told me what kind of person she thinks I am， but I feel if you ask her， she would say that I´m a good kid.I never give her troubles， you know， as a kid， I´ve been strong， seldom go to hospital.As a student， I never need her to push me to study.As a son， I give her a call several times a week to ask how she is doing and her about myself. 


点评：很诙谐很感人的回答！ 


**29.How do your friends describe you?（你的朋友认为你是一个怎样的人？）**


问题分析：其实，这个提问等同于「你的优点和缺点是什么」，只是把同样的话以朋友的口吻表达出来。大家可以参考第 30 题关于优点的回答。 


回答示范：They describe me as a very dependable person.When they have an appointment with me， they never worry if I´ll be late.When they give me a task they know they needn´t push me to do it as I always keep my promise.My friends also say that I´m energetic， and when they are with me， they feel energetic too.That´s why I have many friends and they all enjoy hanging out with me. 


点评：很好的回答！用事实说明了自己的两大优点——令人信赖，活力四射！ 


**30.What do you see as your strengths as an employee?（作为一名公司职员，你觉得自己有什么优点？）**


问题分析：请大家注意，这个问题的前提是「作为一名员工的优点」，它和单纯的「你有什么优点」是有区别的。你必须列举自己在工作场合的优点。 


回答一：I have good time management skills.As Assistant I often have several things in my hands at the same time so I have to manage my time well to work effectively.I paste a very big「Monthly Schedule」on the walls at office and at home， adding the arrangements like sales meetings or friends´birthday parties any time they are scheduled.So I am very organized both at work and in personal life， never missing important things and deadlines. 


点评：「善于管理时间」，是秘书和助理等职业必须具备的优秀素质。 


回答二：I am a planner and my motto is「If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.」I plan everything.I plan my work， the first thing in the morning I do is making a Must-Do list and Waiting-To-Do list.I plan shopping， I always make a shopping list so I never wander in supermarket wondering what is needed， the best way to save time and money！I plan my career too.Since sophomore year I have planned to work as a marketing representative after graduated.So I began to undertake more selective courses of marketing and do related part time jobs， as you can see on my resume. 


点评：「计划性强」，是所有职位都必须具备的优秀素质。 


回答三：I do my job whole-heartedly to achieve good results， as my friends say， I am a workaholic.I always give 100%to my work.In university I worked overnight for experiments.Last month I stayed in the city of Liuzhou for two months， all work， no rest， to finish a project before the deadline. 


点评：「做事情很拼命」，是任何老板都欣赏的素质。 


回答四：My strength is my flexibility to handle changes.I began to like Guangzhou shortly after I ha.come from the Northeast of China and I have made many good friends in a short time.I´ve been sent to three different departments in three years of work at ICBC and I´ve adapted to each new position very well.（如果面试官继续询问你如何适应变化，则继续回答如下。）When changes occur， firstly I learn the new things hard and quickly.Then most importantly， I don´t hesitate to ask for help when needed.I am not afraid of telling others that I don´t know something.Being open-minded is very important in my view， it´s so much better than go and hide in fear of losing face. 


点评：「适应能力强」既是一个生活上的优点，也算是一个工作中的优点。不过，这个回答最绝的地方是它巧妙地把面试官的注意力转移到该申请人在工商银行 3 年换了 3 个岗位这个事实。连续换岗，表明原单位对他很重视，有意识地培养和锻炼他。 


回答五：My strength is that I am quite expressive and I have the passion for expressing myself.When studying in college I wasn´t afraid of speaking in front of the whole class.Now at work I´m not shy about speaking my mind.I believe if we love a job， we must share our views to make it better. 


点评：「表达能力强」，是很多岗位都需要的优秀素质。 


回答六：I am a very active person.I´d rather hang out with people than sit and watch TV.That´s the main reason why I want to be a sales rep.Business trip won´t be a burden for me， it´s a joy of my life. 


点评：「积极好动」，明显是适合销售岗位的优秀素质。 


回答七：I am eager to learn.I am curious about lots of things so that I enjoy reading.When I was a kid I liked to take things apart and saw how they worked.Now I enjoy researching and developing new technology at work， which is a joy for me as well as work. 


点评：「求知欲强」，是技术研发类职业的必备素质。 


回答八：I am passionate about work because I can find lots of fun at work， say， making an achievement， being praised by boss especially in public， or self-improvement.For example， I´ve volunteered to be an Internal Trainer at ou.company to train new staff.Although I make little money for my hard work I´ve gained more important things than money， like presentation skills and confidence. 


点评：「对工作充满热情，并善于在工作中寻求乐趣」，这是一个多么可爱的优点！ 


回答九：My strength is that I am sensitive to what´s happening around， in other words， I pay attention to what´s going on and think about it.I keep up with the latest fashions in our business.For example， I once suggested one of my clients to sell NBA cards and he made around ten thousand Yuan from this business in less than a month.I hit on the idea when my nephew told me many of his classmates were interested in these cards.For another example， an old client once rejected my invitations of dinner three times in a row， and I immediately got a feeling that he was trying to hide something from me.So I visited him the next day and found out that he intended to cooperate with another sports shoe.company.I successfully stopped him from breaking from us by giving him some real examples of failures of this brand.I believe I have to be sensitive to the business and to people or I can´t do my work well. 


点评：「对周边事务非常敏锐」，这是一个非常独树一帜的回答，势必能令听惯了「领导能力强、组织能力强、沟通能力强」等「列强」答案的面试官印象深刻。 


回答十：I have problem solving skills， that is， I can often think of a way to bring a satisfying end to a difficult situation.Let me give you an example at workplace.Last summer I found a very obvious number mistake made by the Project Manager when I was a part time auditor.I would have told her directly if she hadn´t lost her temper for the same kind of mistake made by another auditor.So， come out with an idea that wouldn´t have made it too embarrassing for her.I sent her an E-mail， not only reporting the mistake of the number， but asking a lot of questions about that project.As a result she realized her mistake and didn´t feel very bad because she was still an expert who could answer my difficult questions！ 


点评：「具有解决问题的能力」，这是一个令面试官很感兴趣的优点，他将很乐意与你讨论你是如何解决问题的！ 


回答十一：I am quite innovative.I would rather make a birthday card than buy one.My family likes the special dishes I cook.I´ve planned about half of the parties in my class， the「Mock Intervie.competition」party proved so successful that it´s been followed by many other classes.Last year I helped a MP3 shop owner to build a sales channel in our school.He is a relative of my classmate.When he asked us to hand out some advertisement sheets on campus， I told him that this is not at all an effective way of getting sales， and it might lead to a big fine for paper pollution because students litter this kind of sheets.I suggested that he hire some student agents among freshmen and sophomore as freshmen are the target customers and sophomore are keen to do some part time jobs to make some extra money and to prove themselves.This suggestion proved very effective；what´s more， it even gets support from our school because it is seen as a way of social practice. 


点评：「有创新思维」的确是个优点，不过，我并不建议应届毕业生过多地强调自己的创造性思维。用人单位往往更喜欢听到诸如「脚踏实地」「兢兢业业」「责任感强」等优点。原因很简单，应届毕业生谈创新，往往停留在空谈的阶段。 


回答十二：I have a great sense of responsibility， to the society and to my work.For example I would shout when I saw a thief putting his hand in others´bags， though I only had one chance to do so because I had only witnessed stealing once.I report water leaking in public places immediately.And I really dislike some girls for flushing the toilet before use though it looks clean.I don´t think such people will make good employees， because if they lack responsibility for the society they won´t be responsible for their work.I am always responsible for my work；if I don´t do it to my best I will feel guilty. 


点评：「责任感强」，好哇，只要能够有效证明自己的责任感的确很强，这个优点永远能为你增色不少。 


回答十三：I am persistent.I keep a diary sinc.coming to college.I eat healthy food and exercise as much as possible all these years.I worked for one student organization for three years instead of participating in many organizations. 


点评：「做事持之以恒」，这个优点对于某些员工流动性很大的用人单位来说，具有致命的诱惑。 


回答十四：I am good with my hands， as my parents put it， I have smart hands.At home it is my job to deal with all the minor troubles of water， electricity and gas utilities.At university I´ve scored very well on experiment courses.I am good at web design and I´ve brought some of my designs with me today if you are interested.I believe I have advantages over some other candidates because I am good at dealing with machines. 


点评：「动手能力很强」，是应届毕业生最能打动面试官的优点之一！ 


**31.What do you see as your weaknesses as an employee?（作为一名公司职员，你觉得自己有什么缺点？）**


问题分析：中国面试官往往用这个提问来衡量申请人是否有自知之明或者开诚布公的勇气，外国面试官则往往更加注重这个问题的「后续问题」，也就是——「你将如何避免因自己的缺点而影响工作质量」。 


回答一：I am not a great public speaker.When speaking in public I feel uncomfortable unless the topic is familiar.So I have to be well prepared before giving a presentation.As a matter of fact， I did lots of preparation for our interview today！ 


点评：「不善于在公开场合发表演讲」，的确是很多人的通病。不过，现在越来越多的申请人「喜欢」上了这个回答，造成了人力资源经理们的审美疲劳。我建议大家在这个答案上适当包装，这个申请人做得就很好，他打趣说自己来面试前都做了详尽的准备，无疑会博得面试官展颜一笑。 


回答二：Well， maybe my weakness sounds a little bit strange to you.I think my weakness is that I talk too much.I like to express my opinions.My classmates say I am bossy and like to show off.I´ve also noticed that I don´t listen enough because I am talking too much.So I write down a reminder on my notebook，「Listen more, speak less.」But interestingly enough， even when I feel I am speaking little my co-workers still pat on my shoulder and say，「Susan, you are an active person!」The「talker」impression doesn´t go away easily. 


点评：「说话太多，甚至有点爱出风头」，其实是一个比较可爱的缺点。至少，比招聘一个闷嘴葫芦要强上百倍啊。 


回答三：I pride myself on being a big picture guy， but I have to admit I am not careful enough.Sometimes I make stupid date and number errors， like typing 2004 when it´s 2005！Once I forgot to final-check the microphone when I was in charge of the Welcome Party and caused great panic when it was found to be silent only half an hour before the show began.So I do love to hang out with the「detail」persons.They can depend on me to make plans， and I can depend on them to remind me of the small details.When I can´t depend on others， I always depend on my notebook.I like to write things down in my notebook now， which is the best way to remember every important detail. 


点评：「能看到事情的大框架，有全局观而忽视了细节」，确实有很多这样的人。这个回答的亮点不在于此，而在于他对自己缺点的弥补手段，一方面他乐于和注重细节的人合作，另一方面他选择使用「好记性不如烂笔头」的方法强迫自己注重细节，不错。 


回答四：I do things in haste sometimes.I am eager to finish a task once I start doing it.It looks like strength but it can be a big weakness at work.Haste makes waste.Great haste makes great waste.For example， when I started working for my current boss last year I once made a ridiculous mistake in an urgent report.I typed「shit out」instead of「try to」for the two phrases have exactly the same spelling.So now I often remind myself：Do it right， Don´t do it over. 


点评：「急躁而忙中出错」，通病也。 


回答五：I set unrealistic goals sometimes.For example， lose 10kg in a month， or finish typing a form in an hour.The truth is that I know they are hard to achieve even when I am setting them， but I can´t resist doing so for I need to be motivated by aiming high.But my boss sometimes criticizes me for being unrealistic when making plans. 


点评：「设立不切实际的目标」，的确是个缺点，不过，往往上进心强的人才会有这种缺点。 


回答六：Well， frankly speaking， I think I still need to be more professional.Sometimes I let my emotions affect my work.Last winter I lost a client because I didn´t look very enthusiastic when answering the inquiries of a potential client.He went to another teller the next day when he opened an account in our bank.And he bought ten thousand Yuan Lideying（a investment fund）immediately.This was a big lesson for me， it made me realize that I should learn to be at my best to any client， at any time.You know， always look like an angel， no matter how difficult it is， because it will indeed help me to sell more products.You never know when the customers decide to buy. 


点评：通常，告诉面试官自己的职业化程度还不够高是非常危险的做法，但是，这个申请人以最真诚的态度，给了我们一个很打动人的回答，使得她在一群对自己的缺点欲说还休的申请人中脱颖而出！ 


回答七：I am too sensitive and spend too much time worrying about what others think about me.For example I hesitate to speak out when I disagree with someone in fear of making him uncomfortable.So I have missed some chances to share my views and prove my abilities.I wish I could be more objective and more straightforward when dealing with people. 


点评：「敏感，过分关注别人对自己的看法」，这的确是个不讨人喜欢的缺点。不过，对一些容易脸红、说话柔声细语的小姑娘，这倒不失为一个好答案。如果你刚好是一个大老爷们儿或者阳刚小伙，这个答案则会迅速让 10 个人中的 9 个人讨厌你。 


回答八：My weakness is that I need pressure to work harder.This is my weak point.I tend to perform better when somebody is pushing me， or give me a high goal.I really wish I can work with a very strict boss so he can give me the pressure I need. 


点评：「需要压力才能更努力」，这是大家的通病啊。这个回答的点睛之处在于，该申请人盼望着能遇上一个高标准严要求的老板，从而督促自己更加努力地工作，这是一个多么可爱的令用人单位求之不得的应届毕业生啊！ 


回答九：I am likely to be influenced by the environment.I study hard when I find everybody else studying hard， and I start looking for a part-time job when I find others talking about how important it is！It would be great if I could join Ericsson， as I can be influenced by the high quality people here！ 


点评：「容易受到周围人和事的影响，所以尽量强迫自己和好人与好事在一起」，回答得好！ 


**32.What factors in a work situation provides motivation for you？（工作中有哪些因素能够激励你？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点是，第一，你是什么样的人。能直截了当地告诉面试官自己需要钱来激励的申请人一定是个比较爽直的人，一个需要老板表扬的家伙一定自尊心很强，等等。第二，这份工作到底能否让你满意。 


回答：There are many， I´m easily motivated.Money of course is a key motivator.The sense of achievement also motivates me a lot， say， winning honors， being praised by boss， clients and by colleagues.In addition， pressure can provide motivation to me too. 


点评：很全面的回答，体现出申请人的几大优点，第一，实话实说自己喜欢钱；第二，自己是个容易被鼓舞的人，要知道面试官最怕招聘进来一个不爱钱财不爱美人的冷面人，不爱吃胡萝卜的驴不可能好好拉磨啊；第三，自己是个好胜心很强的人，喜欢获得奖励，获得老板与客户的认可；第四，自己不怕压力！ 


**六、Goals:关于职业目标的问题**


**33.Where do you see yourself being in your profession in five years?How did you establish these goals?（你的 5 年职业目标是什么？你为什么会确定这样的职业目标？）**


问题分析：与中国面试官相比，老外更加重视这个问题。在这个问题上，面试官捕捉的信息点是，第一，这个家伙是个有计划有目标的人吗？第二，他对自己所申请的职业了解吗？他知道这个职位的下一步是什么吗？第三，这个家伙所设立的职业目标切合实际吗？此外，外国面试官往往是你未来的直线经理或者顶头上司，与人力资源部的面试官相比，他更希望遇到一个已经明确决定要在这个领域里发展的申请人。 


回答一：In five years I want to be a brand manager， or， a marketing specialist.As a matter of fact， I don´t really care what title I will have， because you know， it´s too soon to tell now.But， I´m sure about what I´ll be doing at that time.I want to be able to independently handle different kinds of promotion campaigns， make effective use of media， and find out any other means to promote a product or service.That´s where I see myself doing in five years. 


点评：对于有志从事市场推广活动的应届毕业生来说，这个答案可谓中规中矩了。 


回答二：In five years？I think there are two possibilities， either I will be working as a senior sales， or I will join management team as a sales manager.You know during the past three years I worked my way up from a sales reps to sales team leader， and I´ve felt that both positions have their own attractions.So， in five years， I would be happy if I´m a top sales at th.company， or， if I can be a team leader in such a hug.company like Siemens， that would be even better. 


点评：在小公司里，获得一个高职位往往很容易。如果是在大公司求职，你可以尽量淡化对高职位的向往，而强调对工作内容本身的追求。 


**34.What will you do to achieve your career goals?（你将如何达到你的职业目标？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，面试官要捕捉的信息点有两个，第一，你为实现目标而要采取的措施是否合乎实际？第二，你所申请的这份工作能否给你机会让你去一步一步实现自己的职业理想？ 


回答一：To achieve the career goals， I think performance is the answer.If I perform well in the current position， I would naturally win the trust of the management team and move on to the next step of my career path.So， what I´ll do is to work hard， and achieve good results at my job. 


点评：说得很对，把本职工作做好了，升职机会自然就来了。大家都喜欢这样脚踏实地的人！ 


回答二：My long term career goal requires a wide range of skills.What I´ll do is to keep improving myself， at work and through self trainings outside work.As a matter of fact， I´ve started to work on it.I´ve enrolled in a two month English training program in Xindongfang as I know English is important for my job. 


点评：这个答案很精彩，除了列举了未来会做什么，更为动人的是说自己已经开始行动了！ 


**35.What are your salary expectations for this position?Starting salary?Salary in five years?（你期望的薪资是多少？你希望 5 年以后你的薪资是多少？）**


问题分析：必问的环节。 


回答一：I expect to have a salary between 4000 and 5000 as this is the average salary the students of our school can get.But we can negotiate on it anyway.As a new graduate I care about career development opportunities more than the starting salary.As to the salary in five years， frankly speaking， I´ve even thought about it.I hope the more the better， but of course， it depends on what I can do for th.company. 


点评：一个很适合应届毕业生的回答。 


回答二：I make about 4000 Yuan RMB now and I expect a salary from 5000 to 6000.It´s not so easy to tell how much I can make in five years.If I am still at the same position I don´t think the salary then will be too much different， however， I certainly hope I can do more important things for Adidas and then be offered a higher pay. 


点评：一个很适合有经验的申请人的回答。 


**七、Questions:请提问**


**36.What questions do you have for me?（你有什么问题要问我的吗？）**


问题分析：在这个问题上，外国面试官要捕捉的信息点是，第一，你面试前做过足够的功课吗？第二，你对自己所申请的职位有过深思熟虑吗？第三，你是一个有想法的人吗？一个有思想有见解的人，提出来的问题往往是有深度而且不流于形式的；第四，你是一个脚踏实地的人吗？一个踏实的人，往往会更加关注具体的工作内容，而不是问一个海阔天空的大问题。此外，要注意到面试官的身份，如果他来自 HR 部门，你的问题可以和培训与职业发展有关系；如果他来自业务部门，你的问题最好和自己的工作职责有关。 


回答一：My question may sound a bit stupid， but I really want to know， do you prefer to hire male sales reps than female？You know it´s true in many othe.companies.I am a bit concerned about this coz you know， I really want this job. 


点评：不错，利用提问强调了自己对该职位的热诚，同时也直言不讳地表示了自己的忧虑。女性申请人在申请以男性为主导的职位时，比如销售职位，不妨直接询问对方对招聘对象性别的期望值，以及女性在这样以男性为主导的团队中的职业发展问题。 


回答二：May I know what the sales assistants before me are doing now， I mean， she transferred to other positions or left Nike？ 


点评：一个很实在的提问。如果你在一家比较成熟的外企应聘秘书或助理之类的职位，不妨直言相问，原来这个职位的人哪里去了？是离开还是转其他岗位了？ 


回答三：Honestly speaking， I´d really love to know something about your career path in thi.company and how you feel about it， if you don´t mind？You know， we dream to be as successful as you are in the future， so we hope to know how you came all the way to this position…… 


点评：既是个问题，也是个马屁，只要态度诚恳，完全可以。
