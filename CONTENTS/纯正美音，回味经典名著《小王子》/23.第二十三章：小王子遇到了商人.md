## 23.第二十三章：小王子遇到了商人
**【鉴赏】**


神秘的小王子来自另一个星球，因为一朵玫瑰花，离开了自己的星球。在抵达地球之前，他访问过六个星球，他遇见了国王、爱虚荣的人、酒鬼、商人、点灯人、地理学家，后来，他来到了地球，遇到了蛇、三枚花瓣的沙漠花、玫瑰园、狐狸、扳道工和商贩。商贩是小王子在遇见飞行员——也就是我们的叙述者本人——之前，所遇到的最后一个角色。


This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink. 


这是一位贩卖能够止渴的精制药丸的商人。每周吞服一丸就不会感觉口渴。这里 Quench thirst 指的是「止渴」，「swallow the pill」指的是「吃药」。但是为什么要发明这种止渴的药丸？联系上下文，小王子显然很质疑。


**【表达】**


Computations have been made by experts.


**【原文】**


Experts have made computations.


- the little prince encounters a merchant   


"Good morning," said the little prince. 


"Good morning," said the merchant. 


This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink. 


"Why are you selling those?" asked the little prince. 


"Because they save a tremendous amount of time," said the merchant. "Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week." 


"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"


"Anything you like..." 


"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."


【翻译】


「你好。」小王子说。 


「你好。」商人说道。 


这是一位贩卖能够止渴的精制药丸的商人。每周吞服一丸就不会感觉口渴。 


「你为什么卖这玩艺儿？」小王子说。 


「这就大大地节约了时间。」商人说，「专家们计算过，这样，每周可以节约五十三分钟。」 


「那么，用这五十三分钟做什么用？」 


「随便怎么用都行。…」 


小王子自言自语地说：「我如果有五十三分钟可支配，我就悠哉游哉地向水泉走去…」
