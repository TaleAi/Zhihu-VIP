## 9.第九章：为什么相爱的人还是要别离
**【鉴赏】**


在这一章里，小王子离开了他的星球，也离开了玫瑰花。我们知道，他给玫瑰花浇水的时候，几乎落下泪来，而玫瑰花也忍住哭泣。他们十分珍爱彼此。可是既然如此，他为什么还要离开呢？如果玫瑰花当时请求小王子留下来，你觉得他会留下来吗？


两个相爱的人，还是要别离。这样的内容在文学作品中屡见不鲜。


事实上，在文学作品中，journey（旅行）是一个相当重要的主题，人们往往无法认识到自己的幸福与身边人的美好，人们必须离开，创造出一定的审美距离，来反思过去，重新认识自己，才能再次回归最初的美好。


当飞行员停止修理发动机，开始倾听小王子和玫瑰花的故事，他认可了小王子的观点：爱和恋爱关系是最严肃的事情 love and relationship are the most serious matters of all。


玫瑰指的是什么呢？文学评论家 Joy Marie Robinson 认为玫瑰是爱人的普遍象征，


玫瑰和王子关系的本质是神秘的。他们不直接表达对彼此的爱，直到他们痛苦的告别。在此之前，这朵花向她的爱人卖弄风情的暗示，但她从来没有向王子表达过她的感情，直到他说再见。


故事里也没提到为什么王子对虚荣又天真的玫瑰花会有如此的爱


然而，王子也表明自己有点愚蠢。他无法理解玫瑰的奇怪行为，他做出了不可撤销的，固执的决定离开，这让他流下了眼泪。 


许多评论家和传记作者认为玫瑰是圣埃克苏佩里的妻子康素爱萝的代表。圣埃克苏佩里和康素爱萝的婚姻多姿多彩，充满激情，并且经常感到困扰。


事实上，写在圣埃克苏佩里婚姻触礁期的小王子，可以看作是圣埃克苏佩里给康素爱萝的一封详尽的，内省的情书，在这封信中他表达了对妻子的爱，并试图解释自己如何因为离家漫游和惯常出轨导致违背婚姻誓言。


**【表达】**


表达分手


Goodbye.


"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."


Of course I love you.


It is my fault that you have not known it all the while.


**【原文】**


- the little prince leaves his planet 


I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, "One never knows!" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney. 


On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us. 


The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was very close to tears. 


"Goodbye," he said to the flower. 


But she made no answer. 


"Goodbye," he said again. 


The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. 


"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..." 


He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. 


"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you-- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more." 


"But the wind--" 


"My cold is not so bad as all that... the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower." 


"But the animals--" 


"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies-- and the caterpillars-- who will call upon me? You will be far away... as for the large animals-- I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws." 


And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added: 


"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!" 


For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...

我想小王子大概是利用一群候鸟迁徙的机会跑出来的。在他出发的那天早上，他把他的星球收拾得整整齐齐，把它上头的活火山打扫得干干净净。——他有两个活火山，早上热早点很方便。他还有一座死火山，他也把它打扫干净。他想，说不定它还会活动呢！打扫干净了，它们就可以慢慢地有规律地燃烧，而不会突然爆发。火山爆发就象烟囱里的火焰一样。当然，在我们地球上我们人太小，不能打扫火山，所以火山给我们带来很多很多麻烦。


小王子还把剩下的最后几颗猴面包树苗全拔了。他有点忧伤。他以为他再也不会回来了。这天，这些家常活使他感到特别亲切。当他最后一次浇花时，准备把她好好珍藏起来。他发觉自己要哭出来。


「再见了。」他对花儿说道。 


可是花儿没有回答他。


「再见了。」他又说了一遍。


花儿咳嗽了一阵。但并不是由于感冒。


她终于对他说道：「我方才真蠢。请你原谅我。希望你能幸福。」


花儿对他毫不抱怨，他感到很惊讶。他举着罩子，不知所措地伫立在那里。他不明白她为什么会这样温柔恬静。


「的确，我爱你。」花儿对他说道：「但由于我的过错，你一点也没有理会。这丝毫不重要。不过，你也和我一样的蠢。希望你今后能幸福。把罩子放在一边吧，我用不着它了。」


「要是风来了怎么办？」


「我的感冒并不那么重…夜晚的凉风对我倒有好处。我是一朵花。」


「要是有虫子野兽呢？…」


「我要是想认识蝴蝶，经不起两三只尺蠖是不行的。据说这是很美的。不然还有谁来看我呢？你就要到远处去了。至于说大动物，我并不怕，我有爪子。」


于是，她天真地显露出她那四根刺，随后又说道：


「别这么磨蹭了。真烦人！你既然决定离开这儿，那么，快走吧！」


她是怕小王子看见她在哭。她是一朵非常骄傲的花…
