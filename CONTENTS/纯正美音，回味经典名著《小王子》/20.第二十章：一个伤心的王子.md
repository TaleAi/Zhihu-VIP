## 20.第二十章：一个伤心的王子
**【鉴赏】**


本书中，作者只在一个章节集中描述了玫瑰与小王子的故事。但是，几乎在之后的每一章节，小王子都会想到她，「我要对我的玫瑰负责」，「她是那么弱小」……她一直盛开在小王子的心头。在旅途中，小王子从没有停止过对玫瑰的思念。但是，在到达地球后，他发现了一个玫瑰园，竟然看到五千株和自己的玫瑰一模一样的玫瑰，感到万分沮丧和失望，怀疑起玫瑰对自己的意义。


当小王子看到一座盛开的玫瑰园时，他非常伤心。他想起，他的玫瑰花曾经告诉他，she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. 但是，here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden! 他曾经以为，自己的玫瑰花是宇宙中一朵独一无二的花。而连日旅途的辛苦，加上地球之大、之丰富，让他不仅对玫瑰花、也对自己有了重新的审视：


"I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world;


「我还以为我有一朵独一无二的花呢，


and all I had was a common rose.


我有的仅是一朵普通的花


 A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees—


这朵普通的花，再加上三座只有我膝盖那么高的火山，


and one of them perhaps extinct forever...


而且其中一座还可能是永远熄灭了的


that doesn't make me a very great prince..."


这一切不会使我成为一个了不起的王子…」


这样的发现让他很伤心，于是，他躺在草丛中哭泣起来。


**【表达】**


1）And all roads lead to the abodes of men.


Laziness leads to failure. 懒惰会导致失败。


Curiosity can lead to new discoveries. 好奇心会促成新发现。


2）Abode 住宅


3）这段话套用了谚语 all roads lead to Rome. 条条大路通罗马。


**【原文】**


- the little prince discovers a garden of roses 


But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men. 


"Good morning," he said. 


He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses. 


"Good morning," said the roses. 


The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower. 


"Who are you?" he demanded, thunderstruck. 


"We are roses," the roses said. 


And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden! 


"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that... she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life-- for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die..." 


Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees-- and one of them perhaps extinct forever... that doesn't make me a very great prince..." 


And he lay down in the grass and cried.

在沙漠、岩石、雪地上行走了很长的时间以后，小王子终于发现了一条大路。所有的大路都是通往人住的地方的。 


「你们好。」小王子说。 


这是一个玫瑰盛开的花园。 


「你好。」玫瑰花说道。 


小王子瞅着这些花，它们全都和他的那朵花一样。 


「你们是什么花？」小王子惊奇地问。 


「我们是玫瑰花。」花儿们说道。 


「啊！」小王子说…。 


他感到自己非常不幸。他的那朵花曾对他说她是整个宇宙中独一无二的一种花。可是，仅在这一座花园里就有五千朵完全一样的这种花朵！ 


小王子自言自语地说：「如果她看到这些，她是一定会很恼火…她会咳嗽得更厉害，并且为避免让人耻笑，她会佯装死去。那么，我还得装着去护理她，因为如果不这样的话，她为了使我难堪，她可能会真的死去…」 


接着他又说道：「我还以为我有一朵独一无二的花呢，我有的仅是一朵普通的花。这朵花，再加上三座只有我膝盖那么高的火山，而且其中一座还可能是永远熄灭了的，这一切不会使我成为一个了不起的王子…」于是，他躺在草丛中哭泣起来。
