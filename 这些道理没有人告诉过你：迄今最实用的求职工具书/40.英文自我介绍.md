## 40.英文自我介绍
对于英语好的同学，英文自我介绍可能是亮点。 


但是，对于很多哑巴英语患者，英文自我介绍就可能成为弱点……所以，提前准备好尤为重要。 


**一、关于英文自我介绍的几个疑问**


**1.英文自我介绍，要考察求职者什么？**


英文自我介绍有几种不同类型。 


该公司官方语言为英语。这种情况下，考察目的只有一个：你匹配该职位吗？ 


该公司官方语言为汉语，但是经常要用到英语。这种自我介绍考察的往往是你的英文能力，所以你要更加注意吐字清晰、言简意赅、易于听懂。 


**2.多长时间的英文自我介绍最合适？**


一般来说，面对中国面试官的英文自我介绍可以简短一些，常速朗读时间控制在 1 分钟到 1.5 分钟之间比较合适，因为简短一些的自我介绍可以让中国面试官更加容易记住你说的话。 


针对外国面试官的英文自我介绍可以稍微长一点，以常速介绍 1.5 分钟到 2 分钟为宜，因为你必然需要做一些关于人名或地名的解释。 


**3.面试官喜欢什么样的英文自我介绍？**


一般来说，具有以下特点的英文自我介绍符合面试官的期望值： 


短句，尽量使用口语化的短句，易于面试官听懂。慢速，比中文自我介绍速度要放慢至少三分之一，易于面试官放松地倾听。强调，在你需要面试官重点倾听的地方要用语调和语气加以强调，易于让面试官抓住重点。

I´m glad to introduce myself to you. My Chinese name is Ma Lin, but you can call me Rock, my English name.I chose Rock to be my English name because I want to be as tough as a rock.I was born and raised in Changsha, but my parents came from Qingdao so I speak dialects of Changsha and can also understand Qingdao local language. 


I´ll soon graduate with a Bachelor´s Degree in accounting. I think you may have interviewed quite many students from our school, so you know this major prepares us for CGA and most courses are taught in English.My GPA is 3.6，it ranks No.9 in the 115 students in my grade.And I´ve passed 15 exams in CGA, I anticipate I will get the qualification of CGA in 2009. 


Besides having a good academic performance, I was actively involved in student activities. I was in charge of Student Welfare（生活委员）in my class, and then in Student Union of our school.I enjoyed this position because what I did was very important to everybody, although it was mostly small details. 


I had a three month practice job in Zhengzhong Accounting Firm. I did the inventory check, helped the accountants to make the auditing reports.My boss was pleased with my performance and he asked me to recommend my classmate to join our team.

My English name is Mandy, m-a-n-d-y, I wonder if there´re already other Mandy-s in Nestle, because this is a very popular name with Chinese girls. 


I will soon graduate from China Agriculture University, but my major is not related to agriculture, I´ve studied international economics and trade. I like my major a lot so I´ve got a very good academic performance.My GPA ranks No.3 in the class of 60 students.Besides studying I am also an important member of the Student Union of our university and was awarded the honor of Excellent Student Cadre by our school.Outside the campus I did some practice jobs.You may have noticed that one of them was in Coco Cola as a part time Promotion Assistant.I was then working in Vanguard Supermarket to promote the drink「Cool」，or Ku-er in Chinese.It was a very tiring job, because I had to wear the heavy overall of cartoon bear for eight hours a day and jumped around to attract the attention of children.But I did it quite well. 


I´m interested in Nestle because this is a great food and beverag.company, and as a graduate from an agriculture university I have a natural interest in Nestle. Besides interest, I am sure I have the potential to be a great sales rep.，because firstly I love Nestle products, I´ve been a loyal customer of Nestle coffee for years, and secondly I have the necessary qualities of a good sales, you know.communications skills, passion, not afraid of being rejected and so on.These abilities have been proved in my part time jobs.I wish I could use them to sell my favorite Nestle products to more and more people!
